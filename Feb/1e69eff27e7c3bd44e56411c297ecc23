 Mining Indaba increases investment support for junior mining companies in Africa; even more opportunities to increase investment. TSX-listed Thor Explorations has been announced the winner of the 2018 Investment Battlefield for their gold exploration project located in Osun, Nigeria. Thor Explorations CEO, Segun Lawson, accepted the award after pitching the project to a panel of judges made up of leading analysts and investors. Thor Exploration was selected as the most promising of 22 junior mining companies who participated in the battlefield. The runner up is Algold Resources, a gold explorer and developer in Mauritania. “Identifying the best emerging mining companies for investors and supporting the development of new projects is a critical part of Mining Indaba,” says Harry Chapman, director of Content for the Mining Indaba. Junior mining companies who took part in the Investment Battlefield were each assigned a broker mentor who gave advice on delivering presentations and approaching investors. Thor Exploration’s prize includes a free booth and other support to enable their participation at the 2019 Mining Indaba. Feature image credit: Wikimedia
