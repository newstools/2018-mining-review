 The Pretoria High Court, which has ordered that the Mining Charter challenge be postponed in order for the President to start an inclusive consultation process in revisiting the Charter, has declared mining affected communities and networks core stakeholders for the purpose of consultation. The constant exclusion from major decision-making processes, including a review of the Mining Charter, is what led communities and community networks to approach the Court. MACUA, WAMUA and MEJCON-SA, represented by the Centre for Applied Legal Studies, were joined to the matter in November 2017. They have asked the Court to set aside the Charter for a lack of engagement with communities and recognise that communities are core stakeholders in negotiations around the Mining Charter going forward. The Court yesterday, following announcement of the postponement, further recognised that the community applicants’ concerns about being excluded from the process be taken seriously. The order recognises the seven community applicants as interested and relevant stakeholders for the purposes of consultation on the Mining Charter going forward. “This is a historic victory for mining affected communities, who now conclusively have a seat at the negotiation table,” says Wandisa Phama, attorney at CALS. “We are the people most affected by mining activity,” says Elton Thobejane, deputy chairperson of MEJCON-SA. “What the Court has done for us today is recognise that those who bear the costs of mining must be taken seriously. Mining affected communities must be involved in the design of the Charter and the Court order strengthens our position to do so.” “The Court has recognised that our concerns are equally important as those of the mining industry,” says Meshack Mbangula, national co-ordinator at MACUA. “We hope that what this order means is that every time the Department consults with the Chamber of Mines, we are also consulted.”
