 ASX-listed AVZ Minerals has announced the appointment of Nigel Ferguson as MD and Rhett Brans as a non-executive director. Ferguson transitions from technical director to MD of the AVZ Minerals, reflecting the increased role Ferguson is taking in all aspects of the company’s activities, and the increased commitment required at the Manono Lithium project. Ferguson will receive annual remuneration of A$300 000 through a consulting letter agreement. The arrangement can be terminated by either party on six months’ notice. Brans is an experienced director and civil engineer with over 45 years’ experience in project developments. He is currently a non-executive director of Australian Potash  and Carnavale Resources. Previously, Brans was a founding director of Perseus Mining and served on the boards of Syrah Resources, Tiger Resources  and Monument Mining. Throughout his career, Brans has been involved in the management of feasibility studies and the design and construction of mineral treatment plants across a range of commodities and geographies including for gold in Ghana, copper in the DRC and graphite in Mozambique. He has extensive experience as an owner’s representative for several successful mine feasibility studies and project
developments. Brans experience in initially guiding feasibility work followed by planned development and commissioning will be of significant value as the company advances the Manono Lithium project. He holds a Dip. Engineering (Civil), and is a member of the Institution of Engineers, Australia and the Australian Institute of Company Directors.  Feature image credit: Wikimedia
