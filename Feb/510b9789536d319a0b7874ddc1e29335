 The organisers of the Mining Indaba are aware of the critical need to conserve water in Cape Town and that the water shortage has reached crisis point. “We have been closely following the development of the water crisis and have engaged with local government structures extensively on the issue," comments Alex Grose, Mining Indaba MD. "After much consideration, it was agreed to keep the event in Cape Town as it attracts significant investment to the local economy – conservatively estimated at around R700 million over the past 10 ten years,” Tim Harris, the CEO of Wesgro – the official tourism, trade and investment promotion agency for Cape Town and the Western Cape – last week shared the following to future visitors to the city: “Come and enjoy, but be mindful of our drought. We’re open for business and working to use less water to keep the taps running.” Mining Indaba’s economic contribution is just one consideration. “For the event, water conservation and reduction methods have taken a priority. "Reducing consumption is vital, but we also want to offset our water consumption during our stay in the city, and to give our delegates the opportunity to do the same,” Grose adds. Mining Indaba has put in place the following initiatives to help save and offset the water used at the event: Gift of the Givers is the largest disaster response NGO of African origin and we believe they have the correct infrastructure in place to supply water to areas that need it the most. They provide water support in the form of boreholes, irrigation systems, taps, water tanks and bottled water. The other quarter of water being supplied is water that is deemed ‘undrinkable’ and therefore will never flow as tap water in Cape Town. This water is being purchased from the city and is being purified and treated to become drinkable. This has an additional benefit in that it provides income to the city of Cape Town.
