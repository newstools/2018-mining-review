 Golden Rim Resources is pleased to advise that it has received highly positive results from metallurgical test work conducted on samples from the company’s 100% owned Kouri gold project. Burkina Faso- The preliminary gravity and cyanide leach tests were conducted on 10 samples of oxide, transition and fresh gold
mineralisation from reverse circulation (RC) drilling on the Guitorga Lodes. Overall gold recoveries were high to very high for all ore types (oxide, transition and fresh), with an average recovery of 95.5%. The highest recovery of 99.6% was received from fresh ore  and the average recovery for all fresh mineralisation samples is >95%. Gravity gold recoveries were also high with gold distribution to gravity concentrate (amalgamable gold) averaging ~36% with a high of ~68%. Cyanide leach kinetics were rapid, with leaching essentially complete after 4 – 8 hours for all samples. In addition, cyanide leach residues were mostly very low with cyanide consumption also quite low, ranging from 0.25 kg/t to 0.62 kg/t. Lime additions were also moderate. “The results of our preliminary metallurgical test work for Kouri have exceeded our expectations," comments Golden Rim’s MD Craig Mackay. "An average total recovery of greater than 95% and an average gravity recovery of 36% across all ore types are excellent outcomes. “The high gold recovery results on the fresh ore from Kouri are particularly pleasing as are the very quick cyanide leaching rates. The results demonstrate that all of the gold mineralisation from the Guitorga Lodes is likely to be amenable to a conventional gravity and cyanidation processing circuit.” Metallurgical Test Work Details The test work was conducted by ALS Global Ltd in Perth and the following test procedure was utilised: Feature image credit: Golden Rim Resources
