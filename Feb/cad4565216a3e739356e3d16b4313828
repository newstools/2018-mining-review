 MAXAM, a global technological leader specializing in the design, development, manufacture and application of energetic materials presents the latest technological developments it has introduced to simplify its customers' operations, increase productivity and create value. These solutions include the X-COPTER, a drone designed especially for mining and quarrying, and winner of a recent award in Spain as the best idea for the use of drones in civil engineering projects. Equipped with cameras and gas sensors, the X-COPTER allows users to check the safety of the site before and after blasting and measure aspects such as the level of fragmentation of the terrain and the volume of material generated. MAXAM also showcases RIOFLEX, a high energetic, robust and flexible density bulk product that achieves excellent performance in all types of rocks and multiple applications, minimizing the total cost of ownership due to the savings in the drilling and blasting application and the whole value chain of the mine as a result of a better fragmentation. RIOFLEX technology has been tested in more than 140 sites in 25 countries, becoming a benchmark for customers looking to improve the productivity of their mines, quarries and infrastructure projects. “Our experience going back over 140 years and our capacity for innovation allow us to offer customized solutions to our customers, bearing in mind their specific needs and the characteristics of each location and type of operation," says general manager of Terra Solutions, MAXAM's blasting solutions business unit, Manuel García-Sañudo. "In this way we become an integrated partner who shares their objective to improve the safety and productivity of their operations. "This approach has made us a leading supplier of blasting solutions in Africa, where we hope to strengthen our position." Feature image credit: MAXAM
