A storm and consequent electric outage has delivered what could possibly be a massive safety blow to Sibanye-Stillwater. Over 1 000 miners are trapped underground at its Beatrix mine in the Free State. For now, all of the employees have been accounted for and are safe says Sibanye-Stillwater spokesperson James Wellsted. According to an official AMCU statement, this incident is extreme due to the sheer number of workers involved. “Lives might already be threatened due to dehydration and blood sugar issues because of nutrition issues. It is also quite common for adults to be on chronic medication, and it is highly probable that there are some workers who are trapped without access to their medicine.” “This incident also raises serious concern regarding the lack of emergency contingency plans at the mine for alternative and back-up power generation. AMCU received reports that the mine is now attempting to borrow a generator from Harmony,” says AMCU. According to Wellsted, generators have been taken onto site and operators are trying to restore power to the shaft. AMCU president Joseph Mathunjwa has reportedly stated that 40 miners have been safely returned to surface. Feature image credit: Beatrix headgear
