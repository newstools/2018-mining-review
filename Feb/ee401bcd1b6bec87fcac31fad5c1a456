 Tanzania-focused flake graphite development company Volt Resources has lodged its mining licence applications (MLAs) with the Minister for Minerals of Tanzania covering the company’s flagship Bunyu graphite project. Importantly, the MLA’s cover both the Stage 1 development, where an estimated 400 000 tpa of ore will be processed producing a nominal 20 000 tpa of graphite products, and the Stage 2 expansion at Bunyu which is targeted for completion by late 2020 and will be based on the pre-feasibility study metrics of 3.8 Mtpa of ore feed to produce 170 000 tpa of graphite product. As the footprint of the Stage 1 Bunyu project also accommodates the Stage 2 development – with both development stages set to utilise the same mine infrastructure – two MLA’s have been lodged with the minister. The total area covered by the MLAs is approximately 18 km², with single MLs limited to 10 km² in size. The lodgement of the MLAs follows the submission of the environmental and social impact statement, both of which are key approvals for Volt Resources’ near-term development plans at Bunyu. Following assessment and approval by the National Environment Management Council, Volt Resources will be issued with its environmental certificate for the project. “We are continuing to make significant strides towards the planned Stage 1 Development of our Bunyu Graphite Project this year, with the submission of the Mining Licence Applications another key component of this strategy,” says Volt Resources’ CEO Trevor Matthews “Coupled with the recent submission of the ESIS and the partnering with Exotix on the project funding for Bunyu, our focus remains squarely on our shareholder value proposition with the near-term development of what will be a globally significant graphite asset.” Feature image credit: Volt Resources
