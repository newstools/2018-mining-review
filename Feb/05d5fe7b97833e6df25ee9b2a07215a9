 LSE-listed gold miner Acacia Mining said that it had begun a valuation process of its Tanzanian assets for potential sale following expressions of interest from Chinese buyers. Acacia Mining owns and operates the Buzwagi, Bulyanhulu and North Mara gold mines in north-west Tanzania. The company also has interest in the Nyanzaga exploration project. The company confirmed in a statement on Friday that it was “engaging with a small number of potential investors”. “The process remains at a very early stage and there can be no certainty that an agreement will be reached,” Acacia continued. Acacia Mining said that it continues to support the ongoing negotiations between the Government of Tanzania and Barrick Gold Corporation – Acacia's majority shareholder – in seeking to identify a detailed proposal to present to Acacia for review. The company  said that it remains committed to shareholder value and evaluates all opportunities against strict strategic and financial criteria and any transaction will be pursued only if it is determined by Acacia's Board to be in the best interests of all shareholders. Acacia Mining also confirmed that it had not received an approach from any third parties to acquire shares in the company.
