Today, 1 February 2018, dual-listed Golden Star Resources achieved commercial production at its Prestea underground gold mine in Ghana, West Africa. "Achieving commercial production at Prestea underground is an important milestone in Golden Star's transformation into a high grade, margin-focused gold producer," highlights company president and CEO, Sam Coetzer. "It is also a significant historical moment for the Prestea community as it has been over 15 years since the mine was previously in commercial production. "I would like to thank our host communities for their continued support during the construction and commissioning periods." The project construction, including the installation of all ancillary infrastructure, is complete and operational and gold production is anticipated to continue to ramp up during 2018. The West Reef ore body has proven and probable mineral reserves of 1.09 million tons of gold at 13.93 grams per ton of gold. Exploration drilling is underway at the mine with the objective of increasing the annual production rate and extending the mine life. Full year 2018 production guidance for the Prestea complex is 93 000 - 113 000 ounces of gold at a cash operating cost per ounce of $740 - $880. Feature image credit: Wikimedia
