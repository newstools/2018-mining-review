 Avenira says the longevity of the project in Senegal has been increased by mineral resource estimates 10.9 % higher than the previously estimated tonnage at Gadde Bissik. Indicated mineral resource estimates for the Avenira endeavor remains at 34.9 Mt at 20.7% P2O5. This resource update and a planned resource report are key components of Baobab’s Gadde Bissik expansion and upgrade project feasibility study currently being kicked-off by Avenira. At a 10% P2O5 cut-off, the indicated resource tonnage and inferred resource tonnage are estimated at 42.0 Mt at 19.4% P2O5 and 320 Mt at 16% P2O5, respectively. An objective of the feasibility study will be to confirm the mining plan’s cut-off. “This updated resource model showing a continuous inferred resource area over 20 km is yet another strong confirmation of the vast scale of Baobab’s Gadde Bissik resource, and is most welcome as Avenira is actively pursuing engineering studies for the Gadde Bissik expansion and upgrade investment project,” says Avenira MD, Louis Calvarin. The broader Baobab project tenement covers approximately 1 163 square kilometres. The tenement area has been recently granted for three additional years. A Small Mine Permit (SMP) was granted in May 2015 over the area of thickest and highest-grade mineralisation identified at that point in the Gadde Bissik area and the focus of exploration has continued largely within and adjacent to this area since that time, including an infill drilling campaign within the SMP to better define the geometry of the phosphate sequence. In addition, drilling campaigns were carried out further to the east, with the objective to increase inferred resources at Gadde Bissik East and Gadde Escale prospects.
