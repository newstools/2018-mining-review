 With the global thrust toward more-stringent tax transparency regulations, mining companies must do more to garner the public’s support in the countries in which they operate. This is according to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (Deloitte Global)’s report, The future of tax in mining: the evolving global landscape. “Mining companies have arguably led the way in reporting their tax payments and other economic contributions to countries long before such disclosures were mandatory," says James Ferguson, Deloitte Global Mining Tax Leader. "But despite transparency efforts and the industry’s significant contribution to the world’s economy, the industry often struggles with a negative public perception.” “Ultimately, mining companies have to be proactive in convincing the people in the countries in which they operate that they are significantly contributing to the economy. This means finding ways to distill their responses to often complex tax and disclosure rules into simple, understandable statements.” The report explores how mining companies can navigate a rapidly changing, and increasingly complex tax environment by embracing digital technologies, revamping their structures and processes, and rethinking how they interact with revenue authorities and governments as well as how they communicate with taxpayers. Key trends explored include: All of these trends imply that tax functions within mining companies increasingly need to have a voice as well as a clear message. This concept applies internally when making important decisions regarding disruptive technologies, as well as externally when explaining the crux of complicated disclosures to tax authorities or the public. Senior-level executives within mining companies need to proactively engage and put forth their position and key matters and ensure effective and clear communication of their disclosures.
