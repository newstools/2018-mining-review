 Perseus Mining is pleased to advise that performance tests at Sissingué to verify the construction contractor’s warranted operating capabilities of the crusher and SAG mill have been passed and the Sissingué plant is now running consistently at or above name-plate run times and throughput rates. In addition Perseus Mining announced that notwithstanding the fact that low grade oxide ore has been used throughout the commissioning process, gold recovery rates have also consistently exceeded definitive feasibility study estimates. The ramp-up to full scale commercial production at Sissingué is progressing as planned and ‘commercial production’ is expected to be declared from 31 March 2018. The estimated capital cost of the full development of the Sissingué mine and infrastructure, excluding early works but including operations readiness initiatives, was US$107 million and on current estimates this budget will not be exceeded. Perseus Mining has now been transformed from a single mine, single country business to a multi-mine, multi-jurisdiction operation and is well on the way to achieving its goal of producing in excess of 500,000 ounces of gold per year from our three West African operations, namely Edikan, Sissingué and Yaouré. “Passing of completion tests for the crusher and mill at Sissingué is yet another important milestone on our path to declaring commercial production at our Sissingué gold mine in Côte," comments MD and CEO of Perseus Mining Jeff Quartermaine. "To date the journey has been relatively straight forward and we are now looking forward to settling down to generate in the near future, a second positive cash flow stream to supplement the cash flow from our first mine, Edikan in Ghana,”he continues.
