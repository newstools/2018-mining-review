 ASX-listed Golden Rim Resources has received commitments to raise $3.5 million through a placement of approximately 87.5 million fully paid ordinary shares to institutional, sophisticated and professional investors. The placement, which was undertaken at an issue price of 4 cents, was heavily oversubscribed. Funds received under the placement will be used to complete the maiden mineral resource at the company’s flagship project, the Kouri gold project in Burkina Faso, to conduct further infill drilling at Kouri as well as exploration outside the expected mineral resource area, and for working capital purposes. “We are pleased with the overwhelming support the company received for the capital raising from a number of
institutional, professional and sophisticated investors as it reflects the quality of our flagship Kouri gold project," states Golden Rim Resources MD, Craig Mackay. "The results of the current drilling program at Kouri are most encouraging and the funds raised will ensure we can
accelerate the work at Kouri and progress the project as quickly as possible. This will include the preparation of a
maiden mineral resource which is expected at the end of this quarter. "We are also excited about commencing a systematic exploration effort southwest of the expected Mineral Resource area which we believe is highly prospective for the discovery of further significant gold mineralisation, and are looking forward to keeping our shareholders up to date during what is shaping up to be a very exciting period for the company,” concludes Mackay.
