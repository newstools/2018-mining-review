 ASX-listed Lucapa Diamond Company has recovered the first diamonds from its 70% owned Mothae kimberlite mine in Lesotho. The diamonds were recovered through the existing bulk sampling plant and infrastructure at Mothae, which has been refurbished ahead of schedule, as part of the previously announced bulk sampling programme (BSP). The initial diamond recoveries - sourced from residual material and kimberlite stockpiles that are not included in the Mothae JORC resource - were observed during a site visit to Mothae by Lucapa representatives, advisors, brokers and investors following the Mining Indaba Conference in Cape Town. The largest of the diamonds recovered in the first test run was 6.6 carats. As previously advised, the BSP is designed to provide additional resource and data to expand the life of mine, while also generating early cash flows. Construction of the new 150 tph processing plant, including an XRT large-diamond recovery circuit, continues and remains on schedule for full commissioning and commercial production in H2, 2018. Lucapa announced its US$9 million acquisition of 70% in the Mothae assets (including infrastructure) in February 2017. The government of Lesotho owns the remaining 30%.
