Prospect Resources has appointed Sam Hosack to the board of the company as MD. Hosack is a third generation Zimbabwean, residing in Western Australia. He holds a Bachelors Engineering Degree (Hons) from Essex University in UK, MBA from Ashcroft Business School (UK) and respective professional registrations. He has hands on experience in the delivery of large scale mining, power and port projects to market, as well as their operations. For the past 12 years he has been employed by First Quantum Minerals, primarily in its projects team, where most recently he has project managed the building of a port (coal offloading and copper loading), 120 km 230 kV transmission line and a 300 MW coal fired power station for the Minera Panama project in Panama. His mining and operations experience in North and Southern Africa, Europe, Australia and Central America will be central in delivering the Arcadia lithium project and in building Prospect Resources into a diversified mining business. “Prospect Resources is moving from being an exploration company to a mining company and its leadership team is being expanded to include additional personnel with significant mining operations experience," comments Prospect Resources executive chairman, Hugh Warner. "Sam is one of the leading international mining figures of the next generation. "He has built his experience within First Quantum, one of the great international mining companies, whose origins also began in Africa," he adds. "Sam is a strong leader and team player and he is expected to be pivotal in helping the board take Prospect Resources into the ranks of lithium producer companies.”
