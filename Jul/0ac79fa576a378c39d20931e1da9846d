ASX-listed Lucapa Diamond Company and its partners, Empresa Nacional de Diamantes E.P. and Rosas & Petalas, state diamond production increases at the Lulo diamond project in Angola have been generated from a 27% rise in mining volumes. Lulo alluvial mining company Sociedade Mineira Do Lulo (“SML”) (Lucapa 40% owner and operator) produced 5,058 carats of diamonds during the June 2018 quater, an increase of 20% on the previous corresponding period. Lulo continued to regularly produce large and premium-value diamonds during the quarter, with the number of special diamonds recovered up 7% to 61, bringing to 118 the total number of specials produced in H1 2018 (up 24%). The total weight of specials produced during the quarter was up 18% to 1,412 carats for an H1 2018 total of 2,838 carats (up 22%). Specials recovered during the quarter included the largest coloured diamond recovered to date from Lulo (46 carats) and three +70 carat diamonds. The diamond production increases were generated from a 27% rise in mining volumes to 72,671 bulk cubic metres – a record quarterly result. SML held a diamond inventory of 2,755 carats at 30 June 2018, up 61% on the previous corresponding period. This inventory included several large high-value special diamonds held over from the most recent diamond sale. This inventory was after sales totalling US$5 million during the quarter (up 6%) and US$15.9 million for H1 2018, an increase of 3%. These diamonds were sold at an average price per carat of $1,479 for the quarter and $1,642 for H1 2018. These positive sales revenues and prices were achieved notwithstanding the decision to withhold from sale the large high-value specials referred to earlier. The grade recovered during the quarter was slightly lower at 7.0 carats per 100 cubic metres, although the overall grade for H1 2018 improved 10% to 7.1 per 100 cubic metres.
