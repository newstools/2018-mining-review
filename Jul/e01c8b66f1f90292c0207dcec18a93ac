Indiana Resources has appointed Chris van Wijk as CEO, commencing 23 July 2018. Van Wijk is a qualified geologist with extensive experience in both francophone West Africa and East Africa, having led multi-national exploration teams across a range of commodities in several countries. He has a proven track record in base and precious metals exploration, commercial negotiations and business development. "Chris brings a strong exploration skill set and deep experience in Africa," comments Indiana Resources chairman, Bronwyn Barnes. "Together with his strong capability in business development, he is ideally suited to take Indiana Resources forward and drive exploration success in Mali and consider development options for Indiana Resources' Ntaka Hill nickel project in Tanzania. "Recent assay results have confirmed the prospectivity of our gold projects in Mali. "An aggressive exploration programme is planned for the dry season, which commences in October and Chris will play a key role in developing that programme in the coming months. "We are also aiming to expand the company's landholding in Mali - Chris's appointment and the recently announced rights issue will ensure that the company is well positioned to deliver on that objective," she adds. The board welcomes van Wijk and looks forward to working with him as Indiana Resources positions itself to aggressively advance its interest in Mali and continue to work on development options for Ntaka Hill.
