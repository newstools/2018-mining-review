Mintek and Unisa’s College of Science, Engineering and Technology are proud to announce their joint acquisition of a state-of-the-art 3D X-ray microscopy system. 3D X-ray imaging of advanced materials, rocks and minerals allows the ability to “see what’s inside” without physically breaking down the sample. The machine, which is similar to the CT scan for imaging the human body, can be used on different materials. For Unisa it will be important for their research into advanced materials like ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals and new materials benefits from the insights offered by 3D imaging. For Mintek the machine additionally visualises rocks and their processed products in 3D, to directly relate mineral characteristics to their behavior during different stages of beneficiation. “As part of Mintek’s strategy to strengthen collaborative research with local universities, we are excited by this opportunity to build and contribute to human capital development, through our joint research capabilities,” says Dr Makhapa Makhafola, general manager of Research and Development at Mintek. “This is a milestone in our research endeavours, as we push our research agenda to directly benefit the citizens. We are pleased to have Mintek on board," Prof Mamba, executive Dean of CSET at Unisa adds. The instrument will be launched at Unisa’s Science Campus in Florida on 24 July at 13:00.
