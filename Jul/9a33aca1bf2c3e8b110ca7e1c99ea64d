ASX-listed Lucapa Diamonds has recovered a 114 carat diamond from its Lulo diamond project in Angola. The 114 carat diamond was recovered from alluvial Mining Block 6. It is the 11th +100 carat diamond recovered to date and the third so far in 2018, further underlining the special large-stone nature of the Lulo diamond concession. The 114 carat diamond adds to a significant inventory of large diamonds currently held for a later sale by Lulo mining company Sociedade Mineira Do Lulo, including those shown in the feature image on the left. Lulo is Lucapa’s flagship asset, which is a prolific producer of large and premium-value alluvial diamonds. It is the highest US$ per carat alluvial diamond production in the world. Lucapa and its Lulo partners continue to advance their search for the primary kimberlite sources of these exceptional alluvial gems, with three drill rigs available in the ongoing kimberlite exploration programme. In keeping with the company’s growth strategy, Lucapa has acquired a 70% interest in the advanced Mothae kimberlite project in diamond-rich Lesotho. The Mothae kimberlite pipe is a high-quality diamond resource located within 5 km of Letšeng, the highest US$ per carat kimberlite diamond mine in the world. Lucapa is constructing a 150 tph diamond treatment plant, complete with XRT recovery technology, under its Phase 1 development programme and is scheduled to commence high-value production at Mothae in H2 2018. A bulk sampling plant has also been refurbished and Lucapa has commenced testing areas of the kimberlite pipe either not included in the JORC resource or where additional sampling is required. Large diamonds including two yellows weighing 89 carats and 25 carats have already been recovered from these areas in the bulk sampling programme.
