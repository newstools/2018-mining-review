ASX-listed Oklo Resources has signed agreements to acquire the Kossaya and Sari gold projects, located within 5 km of its Dandoko project in west Mali. The projects encompass a combined area of 84 km2 within the Kenieba Inlier to the east of the regionally significant Senegal Mali Shear Zone (“SMSZ”). The SMSZ and associated north east trending splay structures are spatially related to several major gold projects including: Fekola (5.2Moz), Loulo (12.5Moz), Gounkoto (5.4Moz), Yatela (3Moz), Sadiola (15Moz) and Sabodala (10Moz). The projects cover a largely unexplored tract of highly prospective Proterozoic Birimian greenstones in a comparable geological setting to the nearby, multi-million-ounce gold mining operations and recent discoveries. “Oklo is pleased to announce further progress in building a strategic land position near its flagship Dandoko Project in west Mali,” says MD, Simon Taylor. “As is evident from the major gold deposits nearby and the recent success we have enjoyed at Dandoko in a short time frame, we believe this highly prospective and largely underexplored province will continue to unveil further significant gold discoveries. “Oklo now holds a significant footprint in west Mali and is committed to advancing its projects through systematic exploration led by our highly experienced team and backed by our current strong cash position.” Oklo has identified potential northeast-trending structures within the Kossaya and Sari projects, which are considered comparable to those outlined within the company’s nearby Dandoko project associated with the 12 km long, northeast-trending gold corridor recently outlined by auger geochemistry. Exploration work can commence immediately within the new areas, with initial data compilation and planning underway for field programs.
