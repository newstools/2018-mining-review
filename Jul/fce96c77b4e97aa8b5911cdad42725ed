The #AshwinWillemse saga on Twitter – as innocuous as it initially seemed – has split South Africa completely in terms of racial bias. Almost a quarter of a century since the country’s first democratic elections the issue of race is more heated, more vicious and more personal than it has ever been since 1994. Social media shoulders a lot of the blame for this. Recent events in the country have revealed a sinister racial bias that lurks in the assumed anonymity of platforms like Twitter. More specifically to the greater mining industry is the matter of Sasol’s new empowerment scheme: Khanyisa. South African trade union, Solidarity, notched a significant win in its contention at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration with regards to the exclusion of white employees from the scheme. The contention that Solidarity raised was that the employee share transaction did not make provision for white employees at all. Sasol has reiterated that white employees may not go on strike as it is a dispute of rights, stating that courts are the appropriate platforms to deal with the dispute.
