All employees below senior management level in the mining sector should receive equal benefits from the proposed shareholding scheme in the Mining Charter. Originally published in the Mining Review Africa newsletter 2018/07/10 Following the South African Mining Charter Summit, trade union Solidarity has welcomed the position taken by Mineral Resources Minister, Gwede Mantashe, that all employees below senior management level should receive equal benefits from the Charter’s proposed shareholding scheme regardless of race. According to Solidarity’s General Secretary Gideon du Plessis, the minister’s position promotes non-racialism and is in stark contrast to the policy Sasol is currently set to implement through a shareholding scheme that is based solely on race. Du Plessis also says that prominent players at the mining summit were strongly opposed to Sasol’s scheme, and at the summit Solidarity thus directed a request to the Department of Mineral Resources not to approve the Sasol scheme. This department has to approve all shareholding schemes for the petroleum and minerals sectors. During the summit Solidarity also called on stakeholders to avoid further legal action and to rather focus on reaching a negotiated settlement as was the case in 2004 and in 2010 when Charter I and Charter II were drafted.
