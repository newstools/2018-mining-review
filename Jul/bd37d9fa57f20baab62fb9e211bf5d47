In a recent Q&A hosted by BMI Research regarding cobalt the issue of lowering batteries costs will be key to expanding their role as a power source. “Elevated prices will incentivise some battery producers to reduce usage of the material, which accounts for approximately 3% of the overall battery cost,” states BMI. Originally published in the Mining Review Africa newsletter 2018/07/17 It further states: “In addition to rising prices, consumer-conscious technology and EV makers will seek substitutes due to the challenge of ensuring conflict-free cobalt from the Democratic Republic of the Congo which produces over 50% of global supply. “For instance, in May 2018, US-based EV maker Tesla announced the battery content in the Model 3 uses significantly less cobalt in favour of cheaper nickel to reduce reliance on the former.” Players involved in the mining of battery metals will undoubtedly find this very interesting.
