Negotiations in respect of wages and other conditions of employment in South Africa's gold industry between gold producers and trade unions will begin on Wednesday, 11 July 2018. Representatives include AngloGold Ashanti, Harmony, Sibanye-Stillwater and Village Main Reef together with the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), Solidarity and UASA. The current agreements came to an end on 30 June 2018, and the new agreements will be back-dated to 1 July 2018. The companies, led in this centralised collective bargaining forum by the Minerals Council South Africa, together directly employ around 80 000 employees in the three bargaining units engaged in negotiations which include Category 4 – 8 employees, miners and artisans, and officials. By agreement between all parties, negotiations will take place at the Birchwood Conference Centre at 9:00 on Wednesday with around 200 employer and employee representatives expected to participate in the negotiations. Motsamai Motlhamme, Head: Employment Relations at the Minerals Council, who will lead the negotiations on behalf of the producers said: “It is critical that the parties find common ground in the interest of the sustainability of our industry.” This year’s wage negotiations will utilise two plenary chairpersons whose role will be to ensure that the process is run seamlessly. Mr Moe Ally and Miss Duduzile Madubanye have been appointed to these roles.
