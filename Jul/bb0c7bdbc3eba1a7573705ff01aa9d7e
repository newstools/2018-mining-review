"As the NUM, we have always maintained that wages in the mining sector remained too low, and that was as a result of apartheid legacy when the black mining labour force was ruthlessly exploited. "The NUM also maintained that our average member typically has ten dependants, straining their ability to provide for their families. "We expect the employers to negotiate in good faith whilst respecting the central bargaining forum."
