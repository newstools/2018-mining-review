Construction works at Roxgold's Bagassi South underground gold mine in Burkina Faso are on schedule and on track for delivery of first ore in late Q4, 2018. Bagassi South is the second high-grade underground gold mine on the Yaramoko property and is currently in development. Bagassi South consists of two gold deposits: QV1 Zone and QV Zone. Roxgold is currently advancing the development and construction of the QV1 Zone, which is the main deposit of the Bagassi South project. The deposit is geologically similar to the 55 Zone and is located approximately 1.8 kilometres south of the 55 Zone which is currently being mined. The Bagassi South QV1 deposit feasibility study confirmed robust economics for a potential 350-tonne-per-day underground mine. It contains probable mineral reserves of 458 000 tonnes grading 11.54 g/t gold and is expected to increase the Yaramoko gold mine gold production by an estimated average gold production of 40 000 ounces per year to 2023. Bagassi South mine operations would benefit from shared infrastructure, management and support services already in place for the 55 Zone mine. First ore is expected in late 2018.
