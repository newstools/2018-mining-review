The International Institute of Diamond Grading & Research, part of De Beers Group, has announced that its synthetic diamond screening device, SYNTHdetect, has been shortlisted as a finalist for Industry Innovation of the Year in this year’s JNA Awards. SYNTHdetect, launched last year, is the first synthetic diamond screening device to simultaneously test multiple stones in set jewellery and has the industry’s lowest referral rate at around 0.05%. The device thereby significantly increases efficiency and reduces costs for retailers and manufacturers when it comes to ensuring they do not buy any undisclosed synthetic diamonds. “We’re delighted that SYNTHdetect has been shortlisted in this year’s JNA Awards. SYNTHdetect was developed using IIDGR’s proprietary technology and it’s wonderful to see our scientists recognised for their innovation through this nomination," says Jonathan Kendall, President, International Institute of Diamond Grading & Research (IIDGR). "We are very proud of this device’s pioneering approach to screening for synthetic diamond content and continue to receive excellent feedback from our customers.” The awards shortlisting process involved three rounds, including a visit by the judges to IIDGR’s lab in Surat, India, for a demonstration of SYNTHdetect in action. Winners will be announced at the JNA Awards Ceremony and Gala Dinner on 16 September during the Hong Kong Jewellery & Gem Fair. The JNA Awards champion best business practices in the jewellery and gemstone community by recognising and promoting companies and individuals that demonstrate outstanding leadership, innovative thinking, and sustainable and socially responsible strategies, with a focus on their contribution in Asia, and whose ideas and actions have made a positive impact in the trade and communities.
