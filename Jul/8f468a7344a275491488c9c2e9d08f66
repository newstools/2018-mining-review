Emmerson has appointed mining veteran Mark Connelly as chairman of the board. Connelly is an internationally experienced executive with financial, commercial and extensive resource industry experience in CEO, MD and chairman roles. Connelly has approximately 30 years’ experience in financing, development, construction and operation of mining projects having worked with a number of multinational companies across multiple jurisdictions globally including Africa, Europe, Australia, North America and South America. His most recent executive role was as MD and CEO of Papillon Resources which was sold to B2Gold in 2014 for nearly US$600 million. Prior to Papillon, Connelly was MD of Adamus Resources and was instrumental in its merger with Endeavour Mining Corporation in September 2011, where, following the transaction, which valued the combined entity at $597 million, Connelly became COO. He has held leadership positions overseeing the construction of numerous mining operations in Africa including the Fekola project (B2Gold), Mako project (Toro Gold) and Nzema project (Endeavour Mining). Connelly is currently non-executive chairman at ASX / TSX-V listed West African Resources, Tao Commodities and Calidus Resources, former non-executive chairman of Tiger Resources, and a former non-executive director at Ausdrill. Hayden Locke, executive director of Emmerson, comments: “Mark is a seasoned mining veteran and we are honoured to have him join our board as chairman.  He has extensive experience operating in Africa and has assumed leadership roles in the delivery of numerous large scale African mining projects." "He brings a wealth of knowledge, experience and mining industry contacts to the Emmerson team at this critical time as we commence on the development pathway for the Khemisset potash project, which we believe has the potential to be a low capital cost potash mine.”
