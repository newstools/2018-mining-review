A successful rescue operation took place in the early hours of this morning at the Gold One’s Modder East operations, following a fire that broke out underground. At the time of the accident, 644 employees were underground. All of the employees evacuated to the mine's refuge bays wherein they were rescued and brought to the surface. The Minister of Mineral Resources, Gwede Mantashe commends the successful
rescue operation which took place at Gold One’s operations. “We commend all the rescue teams involved, as well as the mine employees and
management, for their swift action in ensuring that we avert a potential disaster,” Mantashe comments. “We reiterate our call to mining companies to prioritise the safety of mineworkers, and
to ensure that everyone adheres to the guidelines provided for safety at the mines,” he concludes. Gold One is an Australian and African gold producer listed on the financial markets operated by ASX limited and JSE limited. Its flagship operation is the newly built shallow depth Modder East mine on the East Rand, some 30 kilometres from Johannesburg. Gold One also owns the nearby existing Sub Nigel mine, which is used primarily as a training centre in the build-up of the Modder mine to full production.
