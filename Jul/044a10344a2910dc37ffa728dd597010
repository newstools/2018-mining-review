Base Resources' Kwale Mineral Sands operations in Kenya, has been on ramping up mining rates and optimising the wet concentrator plant recoveries following commissioning of the Kwale Phase 2 upgrade. Base ResourcesÂ continued activity on its Toliara mineral sands project in the south-west of Madagascar with the appointment of a Mineral Technologies and Lycopodium partnership to deliver the Pre-Feasibility Study. On the marketing front, pricing for rutile and zircon continued to strengthen during the quarter. Following the successful commissioning of a second hydraulic mining unit and upgraded WCP as part of the KP2 mine optimisation project, Base Resources reports achieving nameplate mining and WCP throughput rates of 2,400 tph. The second HMU is an upgraded version of the first HMU and operated at an average mining rate of 865 tph in the quarter, compared to a design rate of 800 tph. With three mining units operating in the quarter a record mining volume was achieved, despite reduced mining in April due to KP2 commissioning. A third and final HMU was commissioned in July, and consequently the DMU has been removed from current service but remains on hand and available, if required. Following the KP2 WCP upgrade, which included a 69% increase in spiral capacity, recoveries of heavy minerals to concentrate have been slightly below design levels but ongoing optimisation at the higher throughput rates and lower grades continue to yield improvements.
