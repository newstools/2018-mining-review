Tuesday 17 July 2018 | 17h00 GMT Renewable Energy World together with its sister publication Mining Review Africa, is inviting you to join in on the live online discussion unpacking the energy storage value chain. The global stationary energy storage market is expected to grow from 3 GWh in 2017 to 300 GWh in 2030, yet the supply chain has yet to be established. Many utilities have begun to offer solar + storage to their customers and more 3rd party investors are placing their bets on the energy metals market. This webcast will briefly look at the supply chain starting from the mine, the investors supporting those mines, and the practical applications of utilities, as well as the solar installer.
