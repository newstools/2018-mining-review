"Crucially, we will retain an interest in Mpokoto through a royalty without the burden of development and production cost. "This strategic interest in turn means that we can concentrate our resources on developing the Mahenge Liandu graphite project in Tanzania, which offers near term development opportunity with multiple value accretive milestones expected this year. "A drilling programme aimed at significantly increasing the size of the deposit is planned for Q2, 2018, whilst the results of a scoping study are due Q1, and a feasibility study is expected to commence thereafter with the objective of reaching a decision to mine in the near term.
