Jupiter Mines has announced the indicative terms of an off-market equal access share buy-back in which it intends to return US$42 million to shareholders. All Jupiter Mines shareholders are to be made an equal offer to have 5.82% of their Jupiter shares repurchased, at a price of US$0.35 per Jupiter share. Pallinghurst owns approximately 18.4% of Jupiter Mines and stands to receive almost $8 million in March 2018. The buy-back follows Jupiter Mines’ $55 million share buy-back in March 2017 and a further $25 million share
buy-back in November 2017, underscoring Jupiter’s strong cash generation ability. The buy-back is primarily being funded by Jupiter Mines’ 49.9% share of a R1.1 billion distribution from Tshipi, along with the profits earned by Jupiter’s manganese marketing business. Jupiter also announced that Tshipi expects to close its financial year to 28 February 2018 with a record 3.3 million tons of sales, record EBITDA of approximately $250 million and record Net Income of approximately $160 million. “Jupiter Mines has exceeded expectations in every way, with Tshipi expected to record manganese sales, record EBITDA and record Net Income for its financial year," says Pallinghurst CEO, Arne H. Frandsen. "Tshipi’s strong performance has seen it almost double its distribution that was announced just last month. The sustained production increase at Tshipi, along with strong profitability, are providing the perfect platform as Jupiter looks to relist on the Australian Securities Exchange.” Feature image credit: Ntsimbintle Mining
