DRA, the global engineering and project delivery group, has completed an Australian acquisition to advance its growth objectives in the Asia-Pacific region. The company has executed an agreement to acquire Minnovo, a Perth based engineering company, which furthers its international growth strategy. Minnovo will expand DRA’s growing Australian footprint and add further depth to DRA’s metallurgical, engineering, procurement, project management, construction and commissioning capabilities in Australia, as well as enhancing on-the-ground resources to clients in the APAC region. Wray Carvelas, CEO of DRA says, “The acquisition of Minnovo will add key resources and experience to DRA’s Australian capabilities and will enhance the Group’s overall strength in the design and construction of processing facilities across a wide range of minerals including ferrous metals, precious metals, base metals and industrial minerals, along with the associated infrastructure requirements.” Greg McRostie, MD of Minnovo adds: “We are excited about combining the Minnovo and DRA capabilities in APAC and we are delighted to be joining the DRA team of 3 300 dedicated people across the globe.” The acquisition is expected to be concluded in the first quarter of 2018. Minnovo does list Africa as one of its target regions to work in.
