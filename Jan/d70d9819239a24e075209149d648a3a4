ASX-listed Lucapa Diamonds and its partners have announced the recovery of large diamonds from the Lulo diamond project in Angola. The latest recoveries include a 116 carat low-quality diamond and a 43 carat yellow gem, both from Mining Block 8 at Lulo. The 43 carat yellow is the largest colored gem-quality diamond recovered to date from Lulo, surpassing the 39 carat pink recovered in September 2016. The 116 carat stone was recovered through the XRT recovery circuit installed at Lulo in late 2016. It is the 10th +100 carat stone recovered to date from Lulo and the second +100 carat recovered within the first three weeks of 2018. Though a low-quality boart stone, the 116 carat diamond continues to underline the special large-stone nature and potential of the Lulo project. Lucapa also notes and congratulates the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho and its neighbor in Lesotho, Letšeng Diamonds, which is 70% owned by London-listed Gem Diamonds, on the recovery of a spectacular 910 carat diamond, which is reported to be the fifth largest gem-quality diamond ever recovered. The Letšeng mine is located within 5 km of Lucapa’s 70% owned Mothae kimberlite mine, which previous trial mining has shown to be a source of large and premium-value diamonds. Mothae remains on track for commissioning in H2 2018, delivering Lucapa a second complementary high value
production source to Lulo. Lucapa will provide a further update on development progress at Mothae in the company’s activities report for the December 2017 Quarter. Feature image credit: Lucapa Diamonds
