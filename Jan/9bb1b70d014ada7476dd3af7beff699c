ChromTech Holdings has completed the construction of a new chrome tailings retreatment plant at one of platinum producer Lonmin's mines - on time and under budget. The R230 million tailings retreatment plant was completed following a 12-month construction period and is part of Lonmin’s larger $50 million bulk tailings project designed to re-mine and process UG2 tailings material. ChromTech Holdings, the South African mine-to-market chrome producer established in 2006, was responsible for the project's delivery. It is the sixth chrome recovery plant that ChromTech has successfully designed, constructed, commissioned and operated in the last 12 years. Steady state production at the plant is expected to be reached by March 2018 with production of around 35 000 tons of saleable chrome concentrate per month. Some 60 permanent jobs will be created by this venture, the bulk of which will be recruited from the local community. ChromTech will market the product through its own logistics and sales infrastructure, which is consistent with company strategy to maximise value throughout the chrome value chain. “Our focus on safety and disciplined strategy execution is yielding excellent results. We are pleased to be creating value throughout the commodity cycle for all stakeholders involved in the project,” says ChromTech CEO, Craig Bennett. On a further positive note, the company is growing an exciting project pipeline, with the synergies from the development of its Bleskop railway siding expected to unlock further value for itself and chrome companies in the surrounding area.
