ASX-listed Nzuri Copper has received a second and final tranche of funds of $3.36 million from Huayou Cobalt. The first tranche was valued at $6.64 million.

 Tembo Capital, the largest shareholder of Nzuri Copper shares, has provided the company with a written statement confirming its intention to vote all of the 132,089,113 shares it holds in Nzuri (approximately 51.44%) in favor of the issue of the Tranche 2 shares on conversion of the loan. Following the receipt of shareholder approval, Huayou Cobalt will be issued a further 13,412,597 shares and, together with its Tranche 1 shares, will have a 14.76% interest in Nzuri Copper (assuming no other shares are issued).

Huayou Cobalt will also be entitled to nominate one representative to the board of Nzuri, subject to all necessary consents and the satisfaction of the Board so long as its holding does not fall below 10% for 90 consecutive days, or a change of control event occurring with respect to Nzuri.
