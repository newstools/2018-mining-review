Letšeng is highest dollar per carat kimberlite diamond mine in the world. The diamond, the largest recovered from Letšeng, is believed to be the fifth largest gem quality diamond ever recovered. “Since Gem Diamonds acquired Letšeng in 2006, the mine has produced some of the world’s most remarkable diamonds, including the 603 carat Lesotho Promise, however, this exceptional top quality stone is the largest to be mined to date and highlights the unsurpassed quality of the Letšeng mine," comments Gem Diamonds CEO, Clifford Elphick. "This is a landmark recovery for all of Gem Diamonds’ stakeholders, including our employees, shareholders and the Government of Lesotho, our partner in the Letšeng mine.” Feature image credit: Gem Diamonds
