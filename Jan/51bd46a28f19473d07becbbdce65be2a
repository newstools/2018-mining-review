Kinross Gold has recently installed a second crusher to increase capacity at the Tasiast carbon-in-leach (CIL) plant, serving the Tasiast gold mine in Mauritania. Kinross Gold reports that the project took place over a three-month period and entailed the installation of a secondary crusher, a 60’ conveyor, a feed-transfer station and an electrical switchroom. The Tasiast processing department had to work quickly and in challenging conditions in order to keep the existing crusher fully operational while the new circuit was in construction. The team was efficient in the installation and only required a 13-day shutdown while the commissioning and changeover to the secondary crusher took place. Installation was conducted over 42 000 construction man hours with zero reported incidents. Following the installation of the new crusher, the crushing circuit is expected to increase capacity to 9 000 tpd from the previous 5 000 tpd. Moreover, the stability of the tertiary circuit was increased and the feed into the ball mills has 10% more fines, with a decrease in size to 11.6 mm from a previous 13.1 mm. “The Tasiast team is very excited to have the construction and implementation of our second crusher completed. It is another step towards our goal of processing 12 000 tpd when we reach full commercial production in Phase One of our expansion,” says Tasiast process manager Wayne Gaiter. Approximately one month since the installation, the secondary crusher has been a success, easily meeting its target of 9 000 tpd. Feature image credit: Kinross Gold
