AIM-listed IronRidge Resources has acquired an additional, highly prospective lithium pegmatite tenure adjacent to its exciting Ewoyaa prospect. Ghana - The prospect is located within the broader Cape Coast lithium project area in Ghana, West Africa. The company has entered into conditional and binding terms with Joy Transporters, a wholly owned local Ghanaian company, providing IronRidge Resources with exclusive rights to the granted Saltpond exploration license and Cape Coast application. Concurrently, the company has submitted an exploration license application through its wholly owned Ghanaian subsidiary, Green Metals Resources, along the interpreted southern extension of the Ewoyaa prospect. In addition, comprehensive preliminary mineralogical studies completed on a suite of surface samples from the Ewoyaa prospect have confirmed spodumene as the dominant lithium bearing phase with a simple process flow-sheet envisioned. Commenting on the company’s latest progress, Vincent Mascolo, CEO of IronRidge, says: “Enhancing and consolidating the company’s ground position along the Cape Coast lithium project corridor is an integral step in our strategy of building a lithium project pipeline in Ghana. “We are very pleased to have secured a partnership with Joy Transporters and we look forward to working alongside them and our other Ghanaian partners to advance the Cape Coast project. Joy Transporters comprises a highly professional and experienced team with a proven track record in mining and stevedore logistics, which bodes well for the future development of our Cape Coast portfolio. “Additionally, comprehensive preliminary mineralogical studies at the Ewoyaa prospect have confirmed spodumene as the dominant lithium phase, providing confidence for a simple process flow-sheet. “We will continue with definition pitting at the Ewoyaa prospect, ahead of planned drilling.”
