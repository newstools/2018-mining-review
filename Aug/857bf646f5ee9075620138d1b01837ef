He has previously chaired the State Theatre Company of Western Australia, the West Coast Eagles (an Australian Rules Football League Team) and several large publicly listed (ASX) companies (in mining and infrastructure). Mark holds a Bachelor of Commerce (First Class Honours) from the University of Western Australia, an MBA from Harvard Business School (Baker Scholar) and an Honorary Doctor of Commerce from the University of Western Australia. He has lived in Australia, the United States, Italy, the United Kingdom and South Africa. Michael W. Scherb, Founder & CEO of Appian comments: “Mark’s addition compliments Appian’s existing Senior Advisory Board, which consists of Chip Goodyear, a previous CEO of BHP Billiton, Lord Robin Renwick, an ex-Vice Chairman of JPMorgan and UK diplomat and Len Baker, a thought-leading investor.
Appian’s Partners and senior management team benefit from the advice and iterative feedback with our board, and Mark will contribute effectively to the discussion.”
