TSX-listed gold miner SEMAFO has increased its security measures at both its Boungou and Mana mines in Burkina Faso following two armed incidents last week. Despite the armed incidents, the Mana and Boungou mines continue to operate without interruption, SEMAFO says. At Boungou mine, the transport of personnel and supplies has resumed between the mine and Ouagadougou under the company’s adjusted security protocol. All expatriate employees are now being transported by helicopter between the two locations. In addition, a ground military force has been deployed on the route between the mine and the capital city. “These measures, combined with a heightened escort presence, will ensure transportation of national employees to and from the mine to their villages,” SEMAFO says. Meanwhile, at Mana mine, further investigation into last week Friday’s incident revealed that SEMAFO’s employee bus had the misfortune of driving into an ongoing hold-up by bandits on the main Bobo road.  This led to an exchange of gunfire, as previously reported. “As part of our new security measures, all expatriate employees will also travel by helicopter between the mine and Ouagadougou. Furthermore, we have reinforced escorts for transportation of national employees to and from the Mana mine,” the company reports. Senior management, including CEO Benoit Desormeaux, are in the country to ensure that all necessary measures are being taken to ensure the safety of all SEMAFO personnel. SEMAFO acknowledges the support from employees, communities and the government as it continues normal operations at both mines.
