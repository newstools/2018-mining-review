Orezone Gold has filed an independent National Instrument (NI) 43-101 technical report entitled “Feasibility Study of the Bomboré gold project, Burkina Faso” with an effective date of July 9, 2018. West Africa - In 2017 Orezone Gold after a detailed review of all historical work, determined that the most viable option for the Bomboré gold project (BGP or the project) would be to focus on the free digging oxide resources with a simple Carbon in Leach (CIL) gold recovery circuit. Orezone Gold subsequently engaged several leading consulting firms to undertake a Feasibility Study (FS) to define and cost this preferred development option and prepare a FS Report and a corresponding Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101)  compliant technical report. The project lies in a northeast-trending belt located to the west of the major Tiébélé-Dori-Markoye Shear Zone that sub-divides the country into domains characterised by different structural patterns. The project area is underlain mainly by a meta-sedimentary flysch-type sequence dominated by meta-sandstones with subordinate carbonaceous meta-pelites and polymictic meta-conglomerates. This metasedimentary sequence is intruded by early meta-gabbroic and ultramafic intrusives and then syntectonic granodioritic intrusives. Latetectonic quartz-feldspar porphyries occur as dikes and larger bodies within the greenstone belt. Large biotite granite intrusives are present on the property to the west and to the south of the greenstone belt that is also moulded on a large quartz diorite intrusive located along the eastern limit of the project. A syenitic intrusion referred to as the Petite Suisse is exposed on the west of the property.
The gold mineralisation on the property is hosted in the Bomboré Shear Zone (BSZ), a major north-northwest to north-northeast trending structure. The Bomboré gold mineralisation trend is defined by a gold-in-soil anomaly in excess of 0.1 g Au/t, as well as by the presence of numerous gold showings and orpaillage  sites. The Bomboré gold-in-soil anomaly measures 14 km in length, is several hundreds of metres in width, and occurs within the BSZ. The BGP area was first explored in 1989  and between 1989 and 2000, various phases of mineral exploration were completed. A total of 1,271 boreholes were drilled and geochemical, geophysical, and trenching surveys were also conducted during this time. Two preliminary resource estimates were made in 1997 and 1998 by Channel (non-compliant, pre- NI 43-101). Channel drilled 10 diamond holes (1,080 metres), 261 RC (19,501 metres) and 1,000 rotary air blast (34,249 metres) boreholes on the BGP during the period 1994 to 2000. There are no records describing the drilling procedures used by Channel in their exploration programme. Since acquisition of the Property in 2003, Orezone Gold has carried out systematic mapping, prospecting, sampling, and gold assaying of outcrops and gold workings. Several airborne and ground magnetic and induced polarisation/resistivity surveys as well as core, RC, and auger drilling campaigns have also been completed that support the geological model used for the current Mineral Resource estimate. Between 2003 and 2014, Orezone Gold completed 1,025 core holes for approximately 156,000 m, 4,703 RC holes for approximately 284,000 m and 4,221 auger holes for approximately 20,000 m. The Mineral Resource estimate is based only on data from core and RC drilling. Data from 276 new holes totaling 15,387 m, within the resource area, were received after the resource database was finalised for the January 5, 2017 resource statement. RPA reviewed the results and is of the opinion that the 2017 resource model is still appropriate to be used as the basis for the 2018 FS.
