The National Union of Mineworkers in the Free State served a 48-hour strike notice to Harmony Gold Mining Company on 29 August 2018. The NUM Free State Region says that it is ‘fed up’ and ‘angered’ with the gold mining company’s conduct at its Phakisa mine in the Free State in that Harmony is busy doing away with all their agreements, and replacing them with company policies. “All our attempts to engage peacefully with Harmony failed and therefore left us with no option but to strike.” The matter was referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) and the NUM was awarded a certificate of non-resolution to the dispute which allowed it to go on strike starting with a night shift on Sunday, 2 September 2018. Thousands of NUM members are ready to go on strike, the union says.
