Public comments on the draft Mining Charter will close on Friday 31 August 2018. This is the last day for the the Department of Mineral Resources to receive written submissions on the draft Mining Charter which was gazetted for public comment in June 2018. The closing of public comments follows over three months of consultations with stakeholders, including organised labour, organised business as well as consultations with communities in eleven areas across the country’s nine provinces, which culminated in a Mining Charter Summit in July. The task team will now consolidate all inputs on the Mining Charter before it is taken to through the relevant Cabinet processes and subsequently gazetted by the Minister of Mineral Resources Gwede Mantashe. "It is envisaged that the final Mining Charter will be published for implementation by November 2018, in order to entrench the necessary regulatory certainty,” Mantashe says. “We wish to thank all those who have submitted their written submissions on the draft Charter. The engagements with stakeholders have been invaluable not only for the Charter, but for our work as a whole as the regulator of this industry. “We remain committed to continue engagements with all stakeholders on issues affecting the industry,” the Minister concludes.
