The crushing circuit at AIM listed diamond producer BlueRock Diamonds’ Kareevlei diamond mine in the Kimberley region of South Africa is now processing at or above the company’s target production level of around 80 tph. South Africa – This follows the installation of a second cone crusher and the implementation of optimisation initiatives at the Kareevlei mine. In June 2018 a fault was discovered in the Company’s cone crusher which led to processing being stopped for around 10 days.  Whilst the fault was being rectified, a rented crusher was installed on site at Kareevlei at a modest additional cost. BlueRock Diamonds’ original cone crusher is now refurbished and operating in tandem with the rented crusher thus increasing the throughput capacity in the secondary crushing process. The crushing circuit now has the capacity to operate at more than 80 tph hour which will enable the diamond miner to produce stockpiled material to alleviate the production challenges in the rainy period from January to April 2019. “With two cone crushers now on site at Kareevlei and stockpiles expected to build up for processing during the rainy season we are in good shape for the remainder of Q3 and Q4 particularly as we prepare to process Kimberlite from our higher grade KV1 pipe, the second of five pipes within the project area. “With this in mind we look forward to the rest of the year with optimism,” says BlueRock Diamonds CEO Adam Waugh. The company will provide an update on its third quarter production in early October 2018.
