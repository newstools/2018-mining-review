Holdings in global gold-backed ETFs and similar products fell by 39 t to 2,394 t in July, pushing assets under management in US dollars down by 4% to US$94 billion from US$98 billion in June. Gold price performance was a large contributor to outflows as it fell over 2% in US dollar terms. All regions experienced outflows in July. ETF outflows were dominated by North American funds, losing US$984 million. Asia experienced the largest outflows on a percentage basis (6.2%), while Europe reversed the recent trend of inflows, losing 8.0 t (US$302 million). COMEX net long futures are the lowest in three years highlighting bearish sentiment in the market. A very low net long level, however, has historically preceded rallies in the price of gold.
