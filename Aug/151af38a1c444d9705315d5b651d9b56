DLA Piper has released its comprehensive guide to the mining sector in Africa. The guide provides a high-level snapshot of the mining industry and regulatory framework across 32 African jurisdictions. The mineral wealth of the African continent makes it a critical region for the mining sector. With the recovery of commodity prices and the return of capital, there are emerging opportunities. DLA Piper will continue to see new commodity supply chains develop in Africa as consumers, particularly in Asia, seek to challenge the monopolies in established mining jurisdictions. Focusing on the business environment in each jurisdiction, the guide offers insight into the current legal framework and development opportunities for anyone looking to invest in what is an increasingly attractive and evolving market. Alex Jones, partner and global co-chair of the Mining sector, says: “It is our ambition at DLA Piper to provide a global platform that facilitates the procurement of legal support for mining projects around the word. "Clients can engage with DLA Piper in their home city, have direct contact with local lawyers in the same jurisdiction as their project, and have recourse to an unparalleled breadth and depth of international expertise and experience. "DLA Piper Africa was established to integrate our service offering across the continent. DLA Piper Africa already comprises offices in 20 countries across the continent and provides an outstanding national and regional service. "We hope this publication will serve as a first point of reference for mining sector participants acquiring projects or commencing business in new jurisdictions in Africa.”
