Dual-listed Sibanye-Stillwater has announced that all the conditions precedent to the DRDGOLD transaction have been fulfilled. On Wednesday, 22 November 2017 Sibanye-Stillwater stated it would exchange selected surface gold processing assets and tailings storage facilities (TSFs), for newly issued DRDGOLD shares. Sibanye-Stillwater now owns 38.05% of the issued share capital of DRDGOLD, currently worth R895.7 million. In addition, pursuant to the transaction, the company has an option to subscribe for the option shares within 24 months from the date of implementation of the transaction to further attain up to a 50.1% shareholding in DRDGOLD at a 10% discount to the 30 day volume weighted average traded price of a DRDGOLD share on the day prior to the date of exercise of the option. Commenting on the Transaction, Neal Froneman, CEO of Sibanye-Stillwater, said: “We are excited about the partnership with DRDGOLD which unlocks value for our under-used surface infrastructure and TSFs, while retaining upside to the West Rand Tailings Retreatment Project and future growth in DRDGOLD. "Further value will be derived from the future development of this long life surface reclamation project, which will benefit all of our stakeholders, particularly those in the region.”
