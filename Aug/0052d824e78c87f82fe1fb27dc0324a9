The world’s largest Australian African business forum – Africa Down Under – will be held in Perth next week as higher investor sentiment returns to the arena after a tough five years on equity markets for Australian explorers and miners involved in Africa’s minerals sector. Western Australia’s Mines and Petroleum Minister, the Hon. Bill Johnston MLA, will open the 1,400 strong delegate conference on Wednesday morning (August 29) at Perth’s Pan Pacific Hotel, with at least 15 African Ministerial presentations over following days. Keynote Australian presenters include Resolute Mining’s John Welborn, decorated Australian mining industry veteran, Hugh Morgan, renowned international resources deal maker, Owen Hegarty, and the Head of Global Mining at the Toronto Stock Exchange, Dean McPherson. The forum is Africa Down Under’s largest turnout since 2013 and will hear from nearly 70 presenters, including at least 35 ASX-listed companies. It boasts a sold-out 90 booth exhibition.
