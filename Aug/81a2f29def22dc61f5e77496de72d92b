Gold wage negotiations continue with gold producers (AngloGold Ashanti, Harmony, Sibanye-Stillwater and Village Main Reef) meeting with the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, Solidarity and UASA. The parties engaged extensively during bilateral discussions around the conditional offer made on 21 August to all four unions involved in centralised collective bargaining for the  sector. AMCU, UASA and Solidarity indicated that they would declare a dispute with Harmony and Village Main Reef, such a dispute will be processed by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). Discussions between the three unions and AngloGold Ashanti and Sibanye-Stillwater will continue on Wednesday, 5 September. Chief Negotiator on behalf of the gold producers, Motsamai Motlhamme said: “Wage negotiations is a process. In the end, parties must reach an agreement. Having said that, it is critical that the agreement reached does not compromise the viability of an industry already in distress.”
