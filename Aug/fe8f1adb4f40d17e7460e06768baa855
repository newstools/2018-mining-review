The latest and second move by the Mineral Council South Africa to increase salaries of skilled employees in the gold sector is lower than Solidarity members expected. However, according to Gideon du Plessis, General Secretary of Solidarity, this move creates a platform for continued constructive negotiations. He says that the increase of the monthly housing allowance from R2 100 to R2 200 is a step in the right direction, but still not sufficient. According Du Plessis, Solidarity welcomes the MCSA's agreement to negotiate further on the revision of production bonuses to investigate the potential negative impact thereof on safety. Du Plessis states that Solidarity welcomes some of the mining houses’ positive reaction regarding the request to offer employees additional medical fund options, and the willingness to acknowledge trade union members who pay their membership fees by debit order because only pay roll deductions are currently acknowledged. A statement from the union reads: "The employers are continuing to be arrogant, and are negotiating in bad faith. "The NUM, together with three other unions, met with the gold sector employers, who negotiate under the auspices of MCSA, on conditions of employment and wage increases. "We can confirm that no progress was made and the employers are still far from reaching our member's demands. The employers latest offers are in the region of between R475 and R525 for categories 4 - 8, and between 3.5% and 4.5% for miners, artisans and officials. "This is despite the fact that the NUM compromised on its initial demands. "The NUM's demands are R9 450 for surface workers, R10 450 for underground workers and 14.5% for miners artisans and officials. "We regard the offers by the employers as disingenuous. "This is indeed a war being declared by the gold producers. "We will take their offers to our members with immediate effect and they are the one who will give us a way forward."
