Seriti, the youngest of South Africa’s coal producers CEO, Mike Teke, was presented with the prestigious Brigadier Stokes Memorial Award for his contribution to the mining industry and his leadership role in South African society. The platinum medal was presented to Teke by the Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy's (SAIMM) outgoing president Professor Sehliselo Ndlovu. The award is the very highest honour to be bestowed by the mining and metallurgical sector and was bestowed on Teke for his substantial contribution to the South African minerals industry over many years, as well as his leadership role within South African society. Instituted in 1980 to commemorate Brigadier Stokes’ influence in the South African mining industry, the accolade first went to Harry Oppenheimer and has since been awarded to mining veterans and business influencers like Patrice Motsepe, founder and executive chairman of African Rainbow Minerals; Bobby Godsell, former CEO of AngloGold Ashanti; Sipho Nkosi, former CEO of Exxaro Coal and Roger Baxter, CEO of the Minerals Council of South Africa. The SAIMM itself is focussed on enhancing technical knowledge in South African mining and metallurgy. The launch by Teke and his co-investors of Seriti, which supplies some 25% of Eskom’s coal, follows his three years as president of the then Chamber of Mines (now the Minerals Council South Africa). Prior to that, his career saw him rise through the management ranks at BHP and Impala Platinum before becoming CEO of Optimum Coal Holdings and more recently of Seriti.
