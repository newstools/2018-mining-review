MOD Resources announced an outstanding intersection of 52 m @ 1.5% Cu and 14 g/t Ag within a vein stockwork in hole MO-A4-003D, from 232.2 m down hole depth at the A4 Dome. The A4 Dome is one of many domes identified within the ~700 km2 T3 Dome Complex. MO-A4-003D includes a high-grade intersection of 15.5 m @ 2.9% Cu and 42g/t Ag, from 268.8 m downhole depth. Bonanza grade assays for narrow individual veins throughout the 52 m intersection include 7.8%, 8.4%, 11%, 11.5%, 12.2% and 15.4% Cu. The highest silver assay is 476 g/t Ag which is associated with 15.4% Cu at the base of the 52 m intersection. This compares with MOD Resources' prior success when T3 was discovered in March 2016. Vein hosted bornite has also been intersected at the A1 Dome, 26 km east of the A4 Dome. The 5 km long A4 Dome lies just 8 km from the 60 Mt T3 pit project and planned processing plant. MO-A4-003D also intersected an interval of vein and disseminated chalcocite and bornite mineralisation from 586.6 m downhole depth, on the NPF contact. Assay results are awaited to confirm the significance of the NPF contact mineralisation intersected in MO-A4-003D. “MO-A4-003D has turned out to be an extraordinary drill hole," comments MOD Resources MD, Julian Hanna. "It has intersected two zones of mineralisation in the early stages of drilling at the A4 Dome which shows strong similarities to the dome which underlies the T3 deposit. “When put into context with T3 and the ~7 Mt of contained copper in other resources to the east of MOD’s extensive licence holdings, this one hole into the A4 Dome has again demonstrated the huge potential of this rapidly unfolding Kalahari Copper Belt. “What is equally as exciting is the second hole at the large A1 Dome, 26 km east of the A4 Dome, has intersected vein hosted bornite at ~192 m and is currently drilling through visible mineralisation. “These latest results have confirmed Airborne EM as the breakthrough technology which our exploration team is using to great effect to find significant new copper in conductive domes with no previous drilling or soil anomalies to guide them.” Four drill rigs are now testing extensions to the A4 Dome vein stockwork and NPF contact mineralisation, at depth and along strike on 200m spaced sections within a 1.8 km target zone, along the 5km A4 Dome. Additional drill rigs are being sourced to accelerate drilling along the A4 and A1 Domes. Hole MO-A4-004D located 150m to the north of MO-A4-003D also intersected mineralisation on the NPF contact. The NPF contact hosts most of the known resources in the eastern Kalahari Copper Belt, including the 100Mt @ 2% Cu ‘Zone 5’ underground resource planned to be developed by
Cupric Canyon Capital, along strike from MOD’s T3 Dome Complex. The district scale potential of the T3 Dome Complex is further confirmed by MO-A1-002D, the second hole to test the large A1 Dome located 26km east of A4 Dome, has intersected approximately 4m of visible, vein hosted bornite up to the current depth of this hole at 193.9m. Mr Hanna added, “Drilling at the A1 Dome is off to a great start with MO-A1-002D already intersecting what appears to be strong bornite veining and is still in mineralisation. We look forward to reporting further news of progress at the A1 Dome, where two drill rigs are now operating.” A4 Dome and A1 Dome lie within the ~700 km2 T3 Dome Complex which forms part of a joint venture with AIM-listed Metal Tiger. The JV holds extensive licences operated by in-country subsidiary, Tshukudu Metals Botswana extending 200 km along the centre of the Kalahari Copper Belt. On 18 July 2018, MOD Resources announced the company had entered into a binding agreement with MTR to acquire MTR’s 30% interest in the T3 project and rights for an option to acquire MTR’s interests in any new JV resource which progresses to a scoping study within three years of completion of the agreement.
