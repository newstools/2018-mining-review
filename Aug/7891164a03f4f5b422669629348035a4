The ongoing bulk sampling programme at ASX-listed Lucapa Diamond Company’s Mothae diamond mine in Lesotho has yielded more special and coloured gemstones. The latest Special recoveries (individual diamonds >10.8 carats) include a 28 carat stone from the North zone of the Mothae kimberlite pipe as well as two light pink diamonds This follows the recovery of other Specials including an 89 carat yellow from the South-East zone, a 25 carat yellow from the Neck zone and a 12 carat white from the North zone. The latest recovery of light pink diamonds, together with the recovery of a 3 carat pink diamond in the historic bulk sampling conducted in 2008-2012, are proof that Mothae also hosts pink diamonds. The ongoing bulk sampling programme is designed to expand the published +1 million carat JORC resource by testing areas of the Mothae kimberlite pipe which are not included in the resource or which require further sampling to enhance the resource. This bulk sampling programme is being conducted in parallel with construction of the new 150 tph commercial diamond plant, which continues on schedule for commissioning in the second half of 2018. The Mothae kimberlite pipe is a high-quality diamond resource located within 5 km of Letšeng, the highest Dollar per carat kimberlite diamond mine in the world. Mothae production will complement the high-value production from Lucapa’s other producing mine, the Lulo mine in Angola, which is 40%-owned by Lucapa Diamond Company.
