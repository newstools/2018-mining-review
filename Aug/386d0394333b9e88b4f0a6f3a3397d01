ASX-listed Oklo Resources has released a progress report on its 2018 Phase 2 drilling program at the Seko prospect within the Dandoko project. Oklo’s Dandoko project and adjoining Moussala, Kouroufing and Kandiole projects are located within the Kenieba Inlier of western Mali and lie 30 km to the east of B2Gold’s 5.15 Moz Fekola mine and 50 km to the south-southeast of Randgold’s 12.5 Moz Loulo mine. The Phase 2 drill program was completed with the onset of the wet season in mid-July comprising a total of 169 AC holes (for 15,484 m), 49 RC holes (for 9,075 m) and 31 DD holes (for 7,147 m) at Dandoko. There were also 690 holes (for 10,210 m) of auger drilling at Kouroufing totaling 41,916 m. The drilling programs tested strike and depth extensions to the previously encountered oxide gold mineralisation with AC drilling to a vertical depth of approximately 80 m and deeper RC and DD drilling to vertical depths of between 180-250 m at SK2, SK3, as well as testing other regional targets along the Dandoko gold corridor and within the Kouroufing project. The Seko auger gold anomalies comprise five coherent gold trends with a combined strike length of 7 km. The SK3 anomaly extends over 1.2 km, with widespread bedrock gold mineralisation
intersected from previous shallow AC and limited RC and DD drilling. Deeper RC and DD drilling has focused on the northern portion of SK3, testing for depth extensions to the previously reported shallow oxide gold mineralisation and gathering structural data to assist in future drill planning. The holes were spaced on 40 m sections over a strike length of 500 m within the broader zone of gold mineralisation that extends over 600 m as defined by the previous shallow AC drilling. Significantly RC hole RCSK18-072, drilled on the most northern section, returned 20 m at 3.03 g/t gold from 209 m that included a higher-grade zone of 3 m at 10.24 g/t gold from 226 m with the hole ending in mineralisation at 229 m down hole depth. This new intersection is located approximately 100 m to the east of the main SK3 mineralisation intersected in earlier drilling. The result is seen as highly encouraging and highlights the potential for further discoveries along trend and elsewhere at Seko. The new zone of mineralisation is open to the north and at depth. Numerous +20 m wide intersections were also returned within the main SK3 trend including 28 m at 2.20 g/t gold from 155 m and 27 m at 1.75g/t gold from 63 m and highly encouraging very wide zones of lower grade mineralisation were intersected. This was highlighted by 115 m at 0.49 g/t gold from 182 m with the hole ending in mineralisation at a depth of 297 m (245 m vertical), which supports the potential for the discovery of a large mineralised system at Seko. Wider spaced RC and DD drilling also focused on the southern portion (8 holes) of SK3 and returned encouraging results including 18 m at 1.64 g/t gold from 37 m, 6 m at 1.30 g/t gold from 36 m and 3 m at 4.77g/t gold from 83 m. The latest RC and DD results confirm that the gold mineralisation at SK3 dips moderately to the west. The mineralisation remains open along strike and now extends from surface to a vertical depth of 245 m and is associated with a broad albite-carbonate-pyrite alteration zone and the presence of a turbiditic unit within a carbonate and greywacke sequence. “These new results from our recently completed Phase 2 drill program confirm our belief that the Dandoko gold project has the potential to host a significant gold resource. "The program delivered 31,706 m of new drilling at Dandoko, producing excellent results. "We look forward to receiving the final results and in addition the first assays from our Kouroufing Project located some 20 km south west of Dandoko. "With approximately 500 km2 of highly prospective landholdings now acquired around Dandoko, Oklo is a dominant player in a world-class gold exploration region. "With plenty of drilling to follow over what is a largely unexplored area, the company is excited to release its results to market as they become available," says Oklo MD, Simon Taylor.
