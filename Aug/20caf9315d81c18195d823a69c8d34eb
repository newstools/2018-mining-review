The Minerals Council South Africa on behalf of the country’s gold producers on Thursday 2 August tabled its latest wage increase offer to the trade unions as gold wage negotiations continue. On Wednesday, 1 August, the mining companies responded further to the unions’ demands and queries, and indicated where they could not consider increases.

Motlhamme urged the unions and employees to “carefully consider” the offers. “Only by ensuring the sustainability of the industry will mines remain viable and able to sustain jobs,” he said. In addition to the wage demands, the gold producers have also made concessions on the following non-wage demands, including living out allowances; meal interval allowances; upgrading category 4 supervisors to category 5; and severance pay. The gold wage negotiations are underway between producers, AngloGold Ashanti, Harmony, Sibanye-Stillwater and Village Main Reef, and representative unions, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), Solidarity and UASA. Negotiations will continue on 15 August 2018.
