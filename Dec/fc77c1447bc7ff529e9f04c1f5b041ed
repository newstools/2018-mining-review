ASX-listed Lucapa Diamond Company and the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho report that commercial diamond recoveries have begun through the new treatment plant at Mothae kimberlite diamond mine in Lesotho. Lucapa MD, Stephen Wetherall, says the commencement of commercial recoveries
through the new 1.1 Mtpa Mothae plant represents another key milestone in Lucapa’s strategic development plan. “Lucapa is on track to become one of a few listed diamond companies globally with production from more than one operating mine. "The high-quality nature of this production from Lulo and Mothae will also enable the group to further its value-enhancing downstream strategy through partnerships with
global diamantaires, where discussions are well advanced.” The new Mothae plant incorporates advanced diamond recovery technology, including two XRT diamond recovery modules designed to recover large and rare Type IIa diamonds ahead of the secondary crushing circuit, thus reducing potential diamond breakage and improving the recovery of unbroken large stones. The plant will be progressively ramped up to its 1.1 Mtpa nameplate capacity following the
implementation of a second plant operating shift. Production from the Mothae kimberlite mine is intended to complement that from Lucapa’s highvalue Lulo mine in Angola, which produces the world’s highest average US$ per carat alluvial diamond production.
