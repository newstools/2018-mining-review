ASX-listed Arrow Minerals has announced the results from recently completed ground induced polarisation (IP) and resistivity survey at the T1a and T2b Prospects within the Strickland gold project. The project is located 125 km north-west of Kalgoorlie in the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia. Results from 3D inversion modelling produced three discrete, high priority anomalies within 150 m of the surface. Each target will be drill tested with angled reverse circulation (RC) drilling in Q1, 2019. In early 2018, Arrow Minerals undertook a petro-physical study on diamond core from the well-mineralised T1a and T2b Prospects, which demonstrated a strong chargeability and resistivity contrast between mineralisation and barren lithologies. Using this information, Arrow Minerals has now undertaken ground IP and resistivity surveys over the T1a and T2b Prospects to define discrete targets for drill testing. The surveys each covered an area of 1 km x 1 km. The T1a prospect is defined by a 2.8 km x 600 m gold-in-bedrock anomaly proximal to a major inflection between two major shears and associated cross-linking structures, within a thick package of ultramafic rocks, mafic amphibolite and banded iron formations. Known gold mineralisation in the region at Evanston and Copperhead is hosted in close proximity to banded iron formations. The IP and resistivity survey at T1a defined two high priority targets both situated at a bend in the regional structural trend with a significant cross-cutting structure. The IP targets are situated beneath gold anomalism intersected in shallow first-pass drilling, including 15 m @ 1.5 g/t and 3m @ 6.7 g/t. Drilling to date at T1a has consisted of shallow aircore holes, with the deepest hole drilled to 38m. The two IP targets start at approximately 100 m below surface. Arrow Minerals plans on drill-testing each target with angled RC holes in 1Q, 2019. The T2b Prospect is defined by a 3.5 km x 300 m gold-in-bedrock anomaly situated along a bend in a major shear within a package of mafic amphibolite and felsic intrusions. Previous drilling at the T2b Prospect has returned 48 m @ 0.7 g/t, including 21 m @ 1.1 g/t and 3 m @ 2.3 g/t from BARRC007. Arrow drilled a diamond hole (BARDD002), as a twin hole to BARRC007, which also returned 34 m @ 0.5 g/t, including 7 m @ 1.0 g/t and 1 m @ 2.9 g/t. The IP and resistivity survey at T2b defined a single discrete high priority target. The target is situated on the foot-wall side of the felsic intrusion associated with the previously intersected gold mineralisation. The IP response of this anomaly is significantly stronger than the drill intercept (BARRC007 and BARDD002) which is currently interpreted to be minor mineralisation along a subordinate fault cutting through a potentially more significantly mineralised body. The IP target at the T2b Prospect starts approximately 75 m below surface. Arrow Minerals is planning to drill a fence line of angled RC holes into the IP target at the T2 Prospect in Q1, 2019.
