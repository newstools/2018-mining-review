ASX-listed African lithium developer Prospect Resources advises that 100 kg of Lithium Carbonate samples have arrived in Australia from Zimbabwe. The samples are ready for distribution to potential off-take partners for evaluation. The samples were produced at Prospect’s pilot plant in Kwekwe, Zimbabwe using petalite ore from Prospect’s Arcadia project. In the production, spodumene and petalite ore is processed into spodumene and petalite concentrate (6% Li2O and 4% Li2O respectively) which is then converted into lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide (LiOH). Prospect’s ability to successfully produce the product from its petalite ore at Arcadia is a first for Africa and positions the company as one of the only companies to do so globally. Prospect is now able to provide samples to potential off-take partners to demonstrate the quality of the product. With this milestone achievement, the company is now re-configuring the pilot plant to manufacture lithium hydroxide. Prospect Resources is an Africa-focused battery minerals company based in Perth with operations in Zimbabwe, and exploration activities in Zimbabwe and the DRC. Prospect’s flagship project is the Arcadia project located on the outskirts of Harare in Zimbabwe. Arcadia represents a globally significant hard rock lithium resource and is being rapidly developed by Prospect’s experienced team, focusing on near term production of petalite and spodumene concentrates.
