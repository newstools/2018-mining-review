ASX-listed Oklo Resources announces that its 2019 field season is well underway with four drill rigs now in operation across its Dandoko and Kouroufing projects in west Mali. The $5 million drilling program consists of 35,000 m of AC, RC, DD drilling and approximately 25,000 m of low-cost shallow auger drilling. Oklo’s Dandoko and Kouroufing Projects are located within the Kenieba Inlier of western Mali, approximately 30 km east of B2Gold’s 7.1 Moz Fekola Mine and 50 km south-southeast of Randgold’s 12.5 Moz Loulo Mine. Okla Resources currently holds ~500 km2 of highly prospective ground in this emerging world-class gold region. “We are pleased to announce a ramp-up of activity at Seko with diamond drilling now underway, the drilling is testing for strike and depth extensions to the known mineralisation," comments MD Simon Taylor. "The arrival of the diamond drill rig complements the aircore and two auger rigs which have been operating at Kouroufing since November. "First pass, deeper aircore drill testing of the Kouroufing auger gold corridor is now well advanced whilst the two auger rigs continue to test the northern and southern extensions of the identified 6 km gold zone. "We look forward to announcing a steady flow of results over the coming months.” Diamond Drilling has now commenced at Seko (Dandoko Project) targeting extensions to previously reported gold mineralisation at SK3 and SK2. An initial program of 3 DD holes with reverse circulation precollars to ~300 m depth is planned.
