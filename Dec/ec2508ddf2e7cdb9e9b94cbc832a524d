The Medical Bureau for Occupational Diseases and the Compensation Commissioner for Occupational Diseases have worked with the Aurum Institute to develop a delivery model to provide much needed medical examination services to ex-miners. The examinations are a necessary part of preparing miners’ applications for compensation for the diseases covered by the Medical Bureau for Occupational Diseases (MBOD) and the Compensation Commissioner for Occupational Diseases (CCOD). They have worked together to perform over 5 000 medical benefit examinations in South Africa, Mozambique, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. Aurum Institute has 20 years of experience in researching the main health challenges facing the mining industry. With the support of Compensation Commissioner Dr Barry Kistnasamy, the Japanese Embassy has donated one of the mobile clinic facilities to Aurum to assist in the delivery of these services to ex-miners in rural areas. “We are most grateful to the ambassador and Embassy of Japan in South Africa.," says Kistnasamy and Aurum group CEO Gavin Churchyard. "This will assist us to further expand medical services to ex-miners in rural areas of southern Africa, to enable them to gain access to the much needed compensation to which those who are eligible are entitled."
