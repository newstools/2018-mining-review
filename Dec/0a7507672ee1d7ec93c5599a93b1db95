AUMS has furthered their investment in simulators from Immersive Technologies after seeing successful results from their initial deployment. This deployment involved two IM360 Simulator Platforms with Conversion Kits for Sandvik Long Hole Drills, Jumbo Drills, LHD’s and Trucks along with Conversion Kits for CAT Trucks and LHDs. African Underground Mining Services (AUMS) has placed additional orders to increase their training capacity, including Professional Services to support the technology integration. “We are committed to investing into quality training that can be applied across new projects. We use the local workforce and the ability to train them using simulators has proven to be a vital part of onboarding and continual improvement.,” says Scott Miller, African Underground Mining Services (AUMS) Group EHS&T Manager. AUMS provides a structured training program utilizing simulator technology to optimize the training process for inexperienced heavy equipment operators. This structured approach extends to their Train the Trainer program where in mutual collaboration with Immersive Technologies, an annual TrainerAdvantage training session was conducted over a two week period at the Immersive Technologies head office in Perth. “Immersive Technologies is our preferred supplier. We can trust the quality and reliability of the product and technology and the support and services offered are second to none,” Miller says. “Training is important to AUMS and they have shown how that dedication can equate to dollars. We are proud to see the results they have achieved and honored with their continued investment,” says Simon Vellianitis, Immersive Technologies, Regional Manager.
