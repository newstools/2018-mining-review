The Sandvik CH800i series of premium connected cone crushers includes a range of performance upgrades. Together with My Sandvik they bring digital transformation to mines and quarries. The CH800i series of connected cone crushers is the first to offer intelligent crushing based on actionable information via the My Sandvik portal. This enables managers and operators to make decisions based on facts, and see areas for improvement directly, increasing uptime and availability. Other automation features continuously measure and compensate for crusher liner wear, while Hydrose and the electric dump valve automatically provide overload protection to let tramp iron or other uncrushable material pass through. ASR automatically adapts crushers to variations in feed conditions. Sandvik CH800i comes with a range of upgrades, including a 65% stronger main shaft, and top and bottom shells that are up to 50% stronger than previous models, offering more reliability and higher availability. “New, digital technologies will transform the way mines and quarries work. My Sandvik is the first major step in gaining insights into productivity and predictive maintenance that will drive our industry forward," says Mats Dahlberg, Vice President Lifecycle Service Stationary Crushing and Screening. It’s great to offer our customers  a service that will truly make a difference to their profitability.”
