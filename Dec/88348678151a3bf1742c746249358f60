Mining Indaba is launching a 'Leaders of Tomorrow' competition to celebrate young leaders and innovators in the mining industry. Part of the event’s Young Leaders programme produced in partnership with Brunswick, the Leaders of Tomorrow competition is a new feature for 2019. “The competition builds on our drive to support young talent in the mining industry and help close the skills gap,” says Mining Indaba MD Alex Grose. The competition is open for applications until 15 December to industry professionals under the age of 35 who have led on a major discovery or innovation in the last two years, with projects moving the industry forward in the fields of safety, water, exploration, mineral recovery and strategy. Four finalists will be chosen to present their 10-minute pitches to the judges on the main stage of Mining Indaba, taking place 4-7 February 2019 in Cape Town, South Africa. The winner will be awarded with mentoring time from each of the judges over the next 12 months to support their career progression, as well as other prizes and publicity opportunities. The judges for the competition are: “We decided to launch the Leaders of Tomorrow competition because we felt that we had a responsibility to support young people’s careers in the mining sector," comments Harry Chapman, Mining Indaba director of content. "The competition will help draw attention to the importance of young talent in the mining industry and will accelerate the career of the winner," he continues.
