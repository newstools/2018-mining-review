JSE/NYSE- listed Gold Fields is disappointed that the South Deep branch of the NUM has decided not to call off the four-week-old strike at the mine. Regrettably, the proposed settlement offer, jointly developed with the National Union of Mineworkwers (NUM) national, regional and branch structures last week, expired at 17h00 yesterday. The offer would, among other things, have increased severance payments and enhanced portable skills training opportunities for retrenched employees and extended the period over which wages lost by striking employees would be forfeited. The NUM branch commenced its strike action on 2 November 2018 to protest retrenchments at the mine. There has been no production at the mine since then and the operation is losing some R6 million per day. The NUM members on strike are not being paid and have lost approximately R80 million in wages and other earnings over this period. Management has received overwhelming responses from employees not supporting the strike and wanting to return to work. However, they fear the intimidation and threats emanating from the small group of strike leaders. “However long the strike continues, it cannot and will not lead to changes in the restructuring plans, including the 1,082 retrenchments, that are necessary for South Deep’s long-term sustainability and saving the remaining 3,500 jobs. Should the strike continue for an extended period of time though, it could potentially place more jobs at risk,” says Gold Fields CEO Nick Holland. “Our immediate focus now needs to be on getting our employees safely back to work and securing their jobs, building our future together and supporting the communities that host us,” concludes Holland.
