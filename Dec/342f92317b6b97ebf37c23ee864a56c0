ASX-listed West African gold junior Tietto Minerals has reported high grade results from drilling at its Abujar‐Gludehi (AG) deposit, part of its Abujar gold project in Côte d’Ivoire. Depth extension drilling at the deposit returned wide intervals of high‐grade gold mineralisation in newly discovered high‐grade shoots: Tietto MD Caigen Wang says: “Depth extension drilling to up to 300 vertical metres from surface is intersecting high grade gold mineralisation below the current JORC resource model at AG, which has a current resource of 646 000 oz of gold to an average depth of 180 m. “Mineralisation in the current model shows potential to support development of an open‐pit operation over more than 1 km of strike length, with substantial near‐surface, high‐ grade gold mineralisation. “Tietto now has two Ausdrill rigs operating at Abujar together with Tietto’s own diamond rig, which will be supplemented in January 2019 by a new and more powerful diamond rig which Tietto has purchased to accelerate its resource upgrade in Q1, 2019 and will permit Tietto to drill deeper holes targeting high grade south‐plunging shoots discovered in November below the current resource.” Tietto commenced a 15 000 m combined reverse circulation (RC) and diamond (DD) resource definition drilling programme project in Côte d’Ivoire in late August 2018. Drilling aims to substantially grow the existing 10.4Mt gold inferred JORC 2012 mineral resource inventory at Abujar. Drilling operations continue with RC, DD and AC rigs active on site. Tietto expects the arrival of its second DD rig towards the end of January 2019. Drilling results will continue to be reported over the coming weeks and months as the company works to deliver an update to our JORC resource statement for both the AG deposit and the Abujar‐Pischon‐Golikro (APG) prospects.
