DMR Minister Gwede Mantashe remains committed to return to Xolobeni, to continue with engagements with the community in order to ensure finality to the matter of mining and development. The South African Department of Mineral Resources' (DMR) Minister, Gwede Mantashe, at his initiative, convened a meeting with the Amadiba Crisis Committee (ACC) on 17 November 2018, with the express aim of hearing their views. At the meeting, the ACC requested the Minister to return to Xolobeni and engage the broader community; to which Minister Mantashe acceded. The Minister had intended to return to Xolobeni this weekend but has since postponed his visit to allow stakeholders more time to prepare. He has also interacted with Richard Spoor, the legal representative of the ACC, on these matters. “His statements issued to the media are rather unfortunate and disingenuous regarding my intentions,” states Mantashe. “This is highly irresponsible and can only serve to fuel tensions in the community.” The DMR says it is the Ministry’s commitment and practice, details of the Minister’s visit to Xolobeni - like in other cases - will be communicated by the department to stakeholders, including members of the media.
