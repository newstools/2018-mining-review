Asanko Gold Ghana, a subsidiary of Canada-based Asanko Gold, has won the prestigious “Mining Company of the Year” and the “Best Performer in Innovation” awards from the Ghana Chamber of Mines at the annual Ghana Mining Industry Awards Ceremony. Congratulating the team, Peter Breese, President & CEO of Asanko Gold says that the company is thrilled that Asanko Gold Ghana has won the highest accolade possible from the Ghana Chamber of Mines and been recognised as “the Mining Company of the Year” amidst stiff competition. “This is a fantastic accomplishment given the fact that we are still a young business. It is testament to the quality of our in-country leadership team, the dedication and commitment of all our employees and contractors, as well as the support from our local communities and host government, that we have been able to win this award in less than three years since we first poured gold and commenced production,” says Breese. Frederick Attakumah, Asanko Gold SVP for corporate affairs and sustainability, added that over the past three years, the whole team, including our service providers, have worked hard to establish the Asanko gold mine as a world-class operator within the Ghanaian mining sector with a strong focus on health and safety, environmental stewardship and community development through jobs, social investment programmes and local procurement. “It is immensely gratifying for this to be acknowledged by our peer group with the “Mining Company of the Year” and the “Best Performer in Innovation” awards,” Attakumah added.
