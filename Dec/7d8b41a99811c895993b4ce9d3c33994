Lucapa Diamond Company and the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho has recovered a 78 carat white diamond from the high-quality Mothae kimberlite mine in Lesotho. The 78 carat white diamond is the largest special recovered through the new 1.1 Mtpa Mothae treatment plant following the commencement of commissioning and recovery of commercial diamonds, again highlighting Mothae’s potential to regularly recover large diamonds. A second operating shift has now also commenced at the Mothae plant as part of the progressive ramp up to the 1.1Mtpa nameplate capacity. “We are extremely delighted to have started our commercial diamond recoveries at Mothae on such a successful and positive note with the recovery of this 78 carat white diamond," comments Lucapa MD Stephen Wetherall. "Recovering such a diamond this early confirms our confidence in Mothae as a large diamond source. “We look forward to completing the progressive plant ramp up phase following the implementation of a second shift at the plant," he continues. Lucapa has a 70% interest in the Mothae kimberlite mine in diamond-rich Lesotho. Lucapa has commenced commercial diamond recoveries at Mothae through a new 1.1 Mtpa diamond treatment plant, complete with XRT recovery technology, under its Phase 1 development programme.
