The Royal Court of Jersey sanctioned the scheme of arrangement which will give effect to the merger of Randgold Resources and Barrick Gold. Trading in Randgold Resources shares on the London Stock Exchange and NASDAQ will be halted on 31 December 2018 and the combined group’s shares will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) on 2 January 2019 under the Barrick name. Randgold Resources' NASDAQ trading ticker “GOLD” will be transferred to Barrick on the NYSE, however Barrick will continue to trade on the TSX under its existing ABX ticker. "The court’s approval is the last major milestone on the journey towards the creation of a new breed of gold company," comments Mark Bristow, Randgold Resources chief executive – and designated president and CEO of Barrick. “Barrick will be the world’s biggest gold miner but our focus will be on making it the industry’s most valued company. "By finding, developing and operating the best assets, with the best people, we’ll deliver sustainable returns to our owners and partners,” he adds.
