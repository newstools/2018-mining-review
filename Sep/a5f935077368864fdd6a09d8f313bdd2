In June 2018 Cadence Minerals announced it had entered into a conditional Heads of Terms with Premier African Minerals to earn up to 30% directly into the Zulu Lithium and Tantalum Project in Zimbabwe. Cadence completed its due diligence, however, and as a result, it was unable to reach final terms with Premier. Cadence is continuing to review several upstream mineral assets, where we see the potential to deliver shareholder value by investing in projects that have a short development timeline to cash flow. It's intent is to earn in at a project level basis, and we are focused on assets where we can both hold larger stakes and also utilise our considerable mining and financial management expertise to achieve a high level of returns.
