Despite having been referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for facilitation, the parties have agreed to continue to engage on gold wage negotiations with a view to reach an agreement. While progress was made during the latest round of gold wage negotiations on 26 September, some unions requested and were granted certificates of non-resolution by the CCMA. These certificates were granted to both AMCU and the NUM at Sibanye-Stillwater and to AMCU at Harmony. However, further discussions between Sibanye-Stillwater and unions will continue, while Harmony will meet with the NUM, UASA and Solidarity during the course of next week. Meanwhile, Village Main Reef and representative unions have also agreed to continue their engagement on 4 October. Chief Negotiator from the Minerals Council South Africa, Motsamai Motlhamme says it is disappointing that all the parties have not been able to find each other yet. “However, we remain hopeful that the parties will continue to work towards reaching an agreement in the best interests of the companies and employees.” To date, AngloGold Ashanti has concluded a wage agreement with the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, UASA and Solidarity.
