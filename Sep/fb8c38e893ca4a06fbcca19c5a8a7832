Cradle Arc has announced that Caracal Gold Mali SARL, its wholly owned subsidiary, has entered into a joint venture agreement with Mukuyu Resources for the exploration and development of Cradle Arc’s 137 km2 Kossanto West Gold Project in western Mali. This comprises the Kobokoto Est and Koussikoto exploration permits. Mukuyu is a wholly owned subsidiary of Indiana Resources an ASX listed base and precious metals exploration company. Kevin van Wouw, CEO of Cradle Arc, comments: “This agreement enables Cradle Arc to advance its highly prospective West African gold assets, whilst maintaining its primary strategic focus on the development of the Mowana Copper Mine. “The terms of the JV do not require Cradle Arc to fund exploration activities up to the PFS stage, such that accordingly there will be minimal impact on the company’s balance sheet as we continue to focus on our core asset in Botswana. “We are delighted to be working with Indiana Resources through their subsidiary, Mukuyu. Indiana Resources has a high-quality team in place and a complementary portfolio of assets in Mali.”
