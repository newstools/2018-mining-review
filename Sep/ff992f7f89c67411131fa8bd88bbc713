ASX-listed MOD Resources has announced the Department of Environmental Affairs has approved its environmental management plan for drilling within a ~700k m2 area in the northern section of the T20 Dome Complex. This is subject to the standard four week public review period which commences on 21 September 2018. The T20 Dome Complex is a ~2,000 km2 area 80 km west of the T3 Dome Complex which hosts MOD Resources' T3 development project and forms part of the extensive regional holdings in the central Kalahari Copper Belt in Botswana held by MOD (70%) and JV partner, Metal Tiger Plc (30%) (AIM-MTR). Diamond core drilling is planned for Q4 with drilling initially targeting the T4 copper prospect and T23 Dome. Significant copper mineralisation was intersected with shallow RC drilling at T4 prior to the discovery of T3, including an intersection of 2 m @ 6% Cu and 111g/t Ag from 101 m depth. Further soil sampling and airborne EM survey data covering T4 has proved very
effective in defining a distinctive conductive structure that may be associated with a strong 5-6 km long copper soil anomaly at T4. This EM structure appears to extend through the interpreted T23 Dome, 15 km west of T4.
Drilling within the T20 Dome Complex is part of MOD’s strategy to demonstrate the regional potential of the Central Structural Corridor which hosts T3 and the recent A4 Dome discovery within the T3 Dome Complex. Six rigs are now operating at the A4 Dome with assay results awaited from several significant intersections. MOD Resources' MD, Julian Hanna expressed the company’s eagerness to commence drilling at the T20 Dome Complex saying, “T4, within the T20 Dome Complex, was the subject of much excitement back in 2016 when we intersected significant copper and silver mineralisation in initial drilling. T4 was eclipsed by the discovery of T3 in March 2016 and no drilling has been carried out since.” He continues: “As with the recent A4 Dome discovery, we are utilising EM modelling to gain an understanding of the potential of the area around T4 and T23 which has highlighted some very interesting features.” The current 940 km2 airborne EM survey over the T20 Dome linking three previously flown EM blocks, is also extending over the T17 and T7 target areas, north and
south of T20 respectively.
