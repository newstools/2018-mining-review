ASX-listed Birimian has restructured its commercial division, which includes more efficient and cost-effective staff deployment in the roles of Company Secretary and CFO. The responsibility for certain accounting and administrative functions will be transferred from Perth Head Office to Birimian’s main centre of activity in Bamako, Mali. The company has also employed a highly experienced Mali-based Exploration
Manager to strengthen in-country technical capability. These moves follow the recently completed systems and procedures upgrade in the Company’s Bamako Office and reflect the fact that Birimian’s resource assets are in Mali and held by three wholly-owned operating subsidiary companies. In relation to commercial and governance aspects, the Company is pleased to announce the appointment of Mark Pitts as Company Secretary and redeployment of Birimian’s Commercial Manager, Alan Cumming, to acting CFO. The company’s former CFO/Co Sec, Noel McAuliffe, has left the organisation by mutual consent. Cumming, a Fellow of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, has more than 20 years’ experience in the mining and resources sector and previously worked with major accounting firms in Africa, the Middle East, the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia. Cumming has held senior finance and administration and general management roles in the resources sector in Australia and Africa, including as CFO of an ASX-listed mining company. Cumming has led the commercial development of the Bamako Office, including implementation of management reporting structures and accounting and administrative systems and procedures. “It is vitally important for Birimian to have a strong and highly experienced management team in Mali and at Head Office in Perth," says Birimian’s Executive Director and CEO, Greg Walker.
