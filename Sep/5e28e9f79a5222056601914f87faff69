ASX-listed Golden Rim Resources has now completed the raising capital valued at $3 million, with the final securities issued. The capital raising was comprised of a placement that raised approximately $3 million and a Share Purchase Plan that raised an additional $392,000 (before costs). Participants were also offered an opportunity to participate in an offer of free options which were made under the Prospectus. All offers under the Prospectus are now closed. Funds raised from the Placement and Share Purchase Plan will be used for work programs at the Kouri gold project (Kouri) where Golden Resource believes there is significant potential for the discovery of further mineralisation. Part of the funds will also be used to complete the Scoping Study on the company’s Paguanta Project in Chile and for working capital purposes.
