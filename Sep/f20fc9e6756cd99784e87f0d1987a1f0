TSXV-listed SRG Graphite has awarded global engineering firm, DRA the feasibility study for their Lola graphite project in Guinea. The project will be executed through DRA's office (DRA Met-Chem) in Montreal with input from other DRA offices across the globe. The award of the study continues the partnership between the company and SRG Graphite. The company has been involved in the Lola project since the early stage, completing two mineral resource estimates and a preliminary economic assessment. In addition, it has provided extensive support through a range of trade-off studies as well as the management of the metallurgical test work and field studies (geotechnical and hydrogeology). "The feasibility study is an important step forward in the development of the Lola graphite project as we move closer and closer to construction", says RaphaÃ«l Beaudoin, P.Eng., VP Operations, Metallurgy and Process Design at SRG Graphite. "We are delighted to continue working with SRG", says Daniel Gagnon, Eng. Senior Vice President Mining, Geology and Met-Chem Operations. "We have been involved in the Lola project since early stages and we look forward to draw upon our experience in Africa to deliver value to SRG."
