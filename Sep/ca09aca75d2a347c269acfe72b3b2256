East Africa Metals has received Draft Model Agreements (DMAs) from the Ministry of Mines, Petroleum and Natural Gas for the company’s Mato Bula and Da Tambuk projects. East Africa - The Mato Bula and Da Tambuk projects are located in the Tigray National Regional State of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The delivery of the DMAs indicates the Ministry has approved the permit application and advanced the permitting process to the next stage. The DMAs set out the rights and obligations of both parties with respect to the development and operation of the Mato Bula and Da Tambuk gold projects and, once executed, will result in the issuance of the Mining License for each project. “This is another important milestone for East Africa Metals and our efforts to establish mining operations in Ethiopia,” comments Andrew Lee Smith, East Africa Metals CEO. “The issuance of the DMAs for the Mato Bula and Da Tambuk projects by the Ministry represents an important permitting milestone and East Africa Metals looks forward to further discussions with the Ethiopian government to conclude the process. "Once issued, East Africa Metals will have three permitted mining projects within a 15-kilometre area of influence," he continues. East Africa Metals is currently reviewing the DMAs and expects to respond to the Ministry after compiling an assessment of the documents. In anticipation of the pending development programme, the company is currently engaged in project financing discussions with potential financiers and development partners.
