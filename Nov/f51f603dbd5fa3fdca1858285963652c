JSE/NYSE-listed Sibanye-Stillwater advises strike action by AMCU at its gold operations has been accompanied by significant levels of violence and intimidation. Sibanye-Stillwater reports that one employee has been killed and a number of employees were seriously injured during the course of the night. Sibanye-Stillwater condemns the violence and urges the unions and employees to strike peacefully and respect the rights of others. Reported acts of intimidation and violence will be investigated and employees who are implicated, will be subject to internal disciplinary measures in line with the company's policy. The safety of its employees is its primary concern and all night shifts have therefore been suspended at the gold operations for the duration of the strike. Operations will continue during the day shift where sufficient employees report for work. On Wednesday, 14 November 2018, a three-year wage agreement was signed between Sibanye-Stillwater and the other representative unions; the National Union of Mineworkers (the NUM), Solidarity and UASA. Despite numerous attempts by Sibanye-Stillwater to reach a fair and reasonable outcome with AMCU representatives since the negotiations began in June, but despite having participated in the construct of the final offer, AMCU declined to accept the offer. The average basic wages for category 4-8 employees have increased by more than 65% since Sibanye-Stillwater was unbundled from Gold Fields in 2013. This is significantly above inflation and represents a very real improvement in the standard of living of our employees. The current wage agreement reached with NUM, Solidarity and UASA is again well in excess of inflation, but takes the longer term sustainability of the gold operations into consideration. Sibanye-Stillwater currently employs approximately 32 200 people at its South African gold operations, with AMCU representing approximately 43% of employees in the bargaining unit.
