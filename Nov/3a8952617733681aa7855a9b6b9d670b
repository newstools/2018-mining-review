MOD Resources, the ASX-listed copper company developing the T3 copper project in Botswana, has had its ordinary shares admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange on 26 November under the ticker ‘MOD’. “We are delighted to be joining a peer group of quality copper companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. The listing allows us to introduce MOD Resources to European and UK investors as we look to develop into a substantial copper producer. The LSE has a strong track record as a leading destination for companies with African mining assets, making it a natural dual listing destination for a company like ours with an exciting copper portfolio in Botswana’s Kalahari Copper Belt,” says MOD Resources MD Julian Hanna. MOD is a copper exploration and development company focused on the central and western Kalahari Copper Belt in Botswana. The company’s primary focus is the development of its wholly owned T3 copper project, for which a feasibility study is targeted for completion in Q1 2019. On 15 November 2018, MOD Resources completed the acquisition of AIM-listed Metal Tiger’s 30% interest in the T3 copper project, giving MOD a 100% interest in this project. The majority of MOD’s prospecting licences outside the T3 copper project in Botswana are held as part of a 70:30 joint venture with Metal Tiger and are subject to options to purchase Metal Tiger’s interest in the joint venture exploration assets at MOD's election over a three-year period until November 2021.
