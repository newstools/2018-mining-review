Surface mining association, Aspasa, believes that more needs to be done by all stakeholders within the industry if industry-wide “Zero Harm” targets are to be met by 2020. The Mine Health and Safety Council (MHSC) accepted the undertaking from stakeholders several years ago and has been steadily working with Government and the industry to progress legislation and best practices to a point where zero harm is actually achievable. However, with the deadline looming, Aspasa director, Nico Pienaar, says that although safety standards have improved significantly over the years, the same accidents that injured and killed miners 20 years ago are still doing so today. Speaking at the Mine Occupational Health and Safety Summit, he added that the identification and management of these risks is pivotal to achieving zero harm in future. The association is therefore working with members to identify these risks and is actively involved in assisting its members to manage them. “We are happy to take the lead in this regard and to guide our sector of the industry towards these future goals. "Although there had been no fatalities within our membership for the past two years, we are actively assisting to plug some of the failures of the Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA) as they pertain to surface miners – particularly small mines and quarries. “There is no specific provision for quarries and surface mines in the act and as a result it leaves gaps in these operations that may prove costly in future. "It’s a fact that smaller mines don’t have manpower to handle compliance issues and we are therefore acting as a stop-gap to assist with training, risk identification and compliance issues. “We also conduct annual on all member mines and quarries during which we identify and give corrective actions for the operations to become compliant and we work closely with the Department of Mineral Resources to do this,” concludes Pienaar.
