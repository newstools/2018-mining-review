Altus Strategies has announced the discovery of the Simret silver prospect at its 100% owned 412km2 Daro Cu-Au-Ag Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide project located in the Tigray Regional State of northern Ethiopia. “We are delighted to announce the discovery of the Simret prospect. Our exploration has returned very high silver grades including 944 g/t Ag, 540 g/t Ag, 277 g/t Ag and 191 g/t Ag from rock chip sampling of quartz veins," comments CE, Steven Poulton. "These veins also returned gold grades of 3.55 g/t Au, 2.56 g/t Au and 2.11 g/t Au along with lead grades of 2.72% Pb and 2.73% Pb. "Geological mapping and stream sampling indicate the potential strike length of the Simret prospect is approximately 2.8 km and 0.5 km in width. "The prospect is located approximately 3 km south of our existing Teklil prospect. At Teklil we have mapped copper oxide mineralisation and discontinuous gossanous outcrop for over 900 m in strike length. “Coincident with this field programme, we have engaged remote sensing consultancy Geosense (Netherlands) to complete a multi-spectral remote sensing analysis of the Daro licence using Sentinel satellite data. “This work has generated numerous iron oxide occurrences across the Daro licence, which may represent key VMS markers. Our exploration team are already following up on these further targets.”
