Indiana Resources has appointed Chris van Wijk as managing director. He is currently the CEO of the company and has 15 years of experience in the mining industry. "His transition from CEO to MD was contingent on satisfying several prerequisites agreed by the board, which van Wijk has now fulfilled in his first three months with the company," comments Indiana Resources chairman, Bronwyn Barnes. His experience ranges from green fields exploration to business development as well as joint venture negotiation and management. Van Wijk is also a member of AusIMM, and has experience in mineral resource reporting and is a competent person under both the Australian JORC Code 2012 and Canadian National Instrument 43-101. “We are happy to announce Chris’s appointment to the Indiana Resources board," says Barnes. "His corporate experience in the resources sector and his proven strategic, corporate and technical abilities will continue to stand us in good stead as we move forward in Mali. In line with van Wijk's appointment as MD, non-executive director Morgan Barron has resigned from the board to focus on his other business interests. The board would like to thank Barron for his contribution as Indiana Resources finalised corporate restructuring plans and exploration activities for 2019. Indiana Resources is a gold-focused Australian exploration company with a strategic position in western Mali and a significant development asset in the Ntaka Hill Nickel Sulphide deposit in south-eastern Tanzania. The Malian projects consist of the Koussikoto Ouest, Kenieko Nord and Kossanto West licences which are located in the well-endowed Kenieba Province of western Mali, approximately 550 km west of the capital city of Bamako. Indiana Resources is looking to aggressively grow its Malian portfolio going forward. The Tanzanian projects include the Ntaka Hill Nickel Sulphide deposit and surrounding tenements. Indiana Resources is actively seeking partners for its Tanzanian assets.
