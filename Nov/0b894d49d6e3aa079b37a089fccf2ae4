ASX-listed gold miner and developer Perseus Mining has increased exploration activities at its Edikan gold mine tenements in order to extend the mine’s current six-year mine life. Ghana - To date, drilling on the Esuajah Gap prospect between the Esuajah North and Esuajah South deposits within the Edikan tenement, has discovered a significant mineralised granite body. Based on results returned to date, the Esuajah Gap discovery exhibits similarities to both the Esuajah North and Esuajah South deposits. Esuajah South has an open pit ore reserve, completed in 2016, of 391 000 oz of gold, while prior to mining, Esuajah North’s ore reserves totalled 475 000 oz of gold. Recent diamond drilling results include: The Esuajah Gap discovery resulted from a conceptual targeting exercise over the mine area and highlights the potential for further discoveries and is encouraging for the prospects of extending the mine life at Edikan. Perseus Mining MD Jeff Quartermaine comments: “We have become increasingly encouraged by the results from our recent Edikan exploration programme that has been aimed at extending the current six-year mine life at Edikan. “We now have sufficient data to delineate a cross section of the Esuajah Gap mineralisation that has revealed encouraging similarities to the Esuajah North and South ore bodies that flank the prospect. “The proximity of the Esuajah Gap discovery to the Esuajah South ore body, that contains 391 000 oz of gold in open pit proven and probable reserves that are not part of Edikan’s current life of mine plan, opens up the possibility of a future joint development of the two deposits and a material extension to the life of mine."
