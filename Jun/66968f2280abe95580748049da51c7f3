Leading mining software solutions and services provider MICROMINE Africa has launched the latest version of its market-leading 3D modelling and mine planning software, Micromine 2018. The company has long been known for its capabilities in the mining industry and continues to increase its footprint in South Africa and Africa as a whole. Micromine 2018 has been developed to adapt to mining operations as they grow during the course of their lifespan. The software is especially easy to use, intuitive and is Microsoft Gold Certified. The company's South Africa Regional Manager Renier Strydom comments that Micromine 2018’s user-friendliness and functionality provides exploration geologists, in particular, an in-depth understanding of their prospective projects and the potential success. The software is module based, ranging from exploration to mining and scheduling. It is an upgrade of the 2016 iteration, with several new features such as a new licensing system that provides end users with a dongle and node-lock options, enabling users to borrow and pool network licences. The mining module has been developed specifically for mining engineers, allowing them to simultaneously display, query, and interactively edit multiple data layers. This assists in developing a mine plan based on the client’s specific mining parameters and business fundamentals. The mining module is a powerful, intuitive tool that helps mining companies plan and design mines, from openpit to underground operations. “We focus on improving its software based on its clients’ needs, with the bulk of the enhancements and new features of Micromine 2018 derived from client recommendations,” Strydom concludes.
