Basil Read's Construction division has for some time been experiencing cash flow difficulties emanating from, amongst other reasons, mismatched cash inflows and cash outflows. Basil Read, is the wholly owned subsidiary of Basil Read Holdings, which houses the Construction division. As a mitigant to such difficulties, the company endeavoured to raise bridge funding from a consortium of lenders, for the finalization of the construction contracts, against the
provision of security, pending anticipated cash inflows to be sourced from the disposal of noncore assets, finalisation of various contracts, and the successful implementation of
various operational action steps. Regrettably, after protracted negotiations with such consortium of lenders, the company  was advised on 14 June 2018 that the majority of such consortium of lenders were not
prepared to make such bridge funding available to Basil Read in an informal process, that is, outside of business rescue. Absent such bridge funding, and pursuant to having obtained the prerequisite legal and accounting advice, the Board determined that Basil Read was or would be facing
circumstances constituting "financial distress" within the meaning of the Companies Act 71 of 2008. As a result, the Board advised Basil Read Holdings that it has commenced with voluntary business rescue proceedings as provided for by section 129 of the Companies Act. The company has appointed Siviwe Dongwana of Adamentem Chartered Accountants and John Lightfoot of Matuson and Associates as business rescue practitioners. The requisite documents were lodged with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC) on 14 June 2018, and the company awaits confirmation of filing from the CIPC.
