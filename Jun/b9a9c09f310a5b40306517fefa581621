The first round of analytical results from ASX-listed Indiana Resources’ shallow, wide spaced, reconnaissance drilling programme has returned strong gold intersections at its Koussikoto Ouest gold project. Mali - A reconnaissance drilling programme of 4 325 m was undertaken during May 2018 at the company’s Koussikoto project and Kenieko Nord exploration property in Mali. Analytical results have been received for 105 holes at Koussikoto. Assay results for the drilling programme at Kenieko, comprising 19 holes for 358 m, and the remaining 45 holes at Koussikoto are expected shortly. Significant intersections for Koussikoto include the following: Indiana Resources’ chairman, Bronwyn Barnes, comments, “This is an exciting start to our exploration activities in Mali and the results confirm the prospectivity of Koussikoto and highlight the potential opportunity for the project. “The rainy season, which is currently under way, provides an opportunity to develop an expanded exploration programme at Koussikoto that builds on these initial results and that will be the focus of effort in the coming months, allowing us to hit the ground running in October.” At this stage, Indiana Resources intends to implement a multi-faceted exploration campaign at Koussikoto, which is expected to commence following the end of the rainy season in October 2018. This programme will follow up and infill drill adjacent to recent significant intersections and include an expanded programme of reconnaissance auger and aircore drilling to investigate poorly explored areas in the west and east of the Koussikoto property. Koussikoto and Kenieko are both located in the prolifically gold mineralised Kenieba Province of western Mali, where there have been multiple large-scale gold discoveries. Koussikoto straddles the gold mineralised Main Transcurrent Zone (MTZ) in the far west of the Kenieba Province, along strike from the Massawa (+3 Moz) and Sabodala (+2 Moz) gold deposits in Senegal.
