Sibanye-Stillwater has suffered another employee fatality, this time at its Khomanani mine at the Driefontein operation. For reasons still to be determined, the employee entered a scraper path and was caught by the scraper and was fatally injured. The board and management of Sibanye-Stillwater have extended their sincere condolences to the families, friends of the deceased employee and have emphasised that all efforts are being focussed on addressing this perplexing increase in safety incidents. As per regulatory convention, an investigation into the incident will be carried out by management, together with the DMR and other stakeholders. Sibanye-Stillwater hosted its first multi-stakeholder safety and health summit on 25 May 2018 which was attended by key industry stakeholders including the DMR, AMCU, NUM, UASA and Solidarity. The company is calling for the support and contribution of all of its stakeholders at the second safety summit which has been convened by Sibanye-Stillwater and is scheduled to be held on Friday, 29 June. The aim of the safety and health summit is to collectively address these incidents, prevent the loss of lives at Sibanye-Stillwater’s operations and re-establish its safety record. As at 18 June 2018, Sibanye-Stillwater’s operations had been responsible for 20 of the 45 fatalities in the mining industry reported since the beginning of the year. In response to the high fatality rate at the company’s operations, the Department of Mineral Resources’ acting Chief Inspector of Mines is compiling a report on all accidents that occurred at Sibanye-Stillwater operations since the beginning of this year. “This will enable us to take appropriate action, guided by the Mine Health and Safety Act, as opposed to a knee-jerk reaction,” says DMR mining minister Gwede Mantashe.
