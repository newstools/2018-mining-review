Gemfields has launched a global advertising campaign to raise awareness of responsible sourcing in the gemstone industry. This will promote Zambian emeralds from its Kagem mine in Lufwanyama. Gemfields believes that coloured gemstones should be mined and marketed by championing three key values – transparency, integrity and legitimacy – and seeks to challenge itself and the sector by setting new benchmarks for responsible sourcing. The campaign was designed to bring these core values and Gemfields’ associated initiatives to life, highlighting the breadth of activities involved in responsibly supplying coloured gemstones to global markets. “We wanted to bring to life the many stories behind responsibly sourcing precious gemstones in Africa as there is far more to our business than industry-leading mining and geology,” explains Emily Dungey, group marketing and communications director. “The characters in the campaign allow us to build awareness of the many life-changing community projects we carry out, our pioneering quest for greater transparency across the industry and the support we provide for vital conservation work protecting Africa’s biodiversity. "The campaign is a snapshot of who we are: it’s fun, unexpected and non-conformist, but also gives an insight into some of the ways in which Gemfields strives to leave a positive and lasting impact," she continues. Gemfields’ mine sites will return substantially to their original state, leaving in place the wider positive effects of improved community healthcare, education, sustainable livelihoods and conservation efforts. The campaign highlights how each gemstone is distinctive, possessing its own personality and character, much like original pieces of art.
