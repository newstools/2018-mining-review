Following the MV Nyerere ferry disaster on Lake Victoria in Kenya last week which tragically claimed 228 lives, Acacia Mining has donated TZS80m to the government of Tanzania to help with relief efforts. Acacia Mining has also sent a team of its employees to assist the Government in the rescue mission, as well as providing other support and medical equipment. A total of 41 people have been rescued while the ill-fated ferry has also been turned upright to further aid rescue and recovery efforts. Of Acacia’s TZS80m total donation, each of its mine sites in the Lake Zone - Bulyanhulu, Buzwagi and North Mara- have contributed TZS20m/- with the remaining amount being donated by the Acacia Group. Commenting on the donation and relief efforts, Acacia Mining MD for Tanzania, Asa Mwaipopo, notes that the company has so far provided a variety of assistance to the Government’s rescue mission and the latest support is aimed at helping victims and their families affected by the tragedy. “As we make this donation, our sincere sympathies go out to the nation and we remain in constant prayer for those affected by this terrible disaster. "We would also like to recognise the bravery and tireless efforts of the rescuers who have done so much to help in such difficult circumstances,” he continues.
