Northam advises that wage negotiations at its Zondereinde mine with the National Union of Mineworkers have been concluded. The three-year agreement provides for increases in basic wages for entry level underground employees of R1 000.00 in the first year, R1 100.00 in the
second year, and R1 200.00 in the third year, and a R200.00 annual increase in
housing/living out allowances over the three year period. In terms of the agreement, supervisory employees will receive a basic increase of
7% per year for each of the three years and a 6% annual increase for housing/living
out allowances over the same period. Paul Dunne, Northam CEO, says: “We recognise the mature and constructive manner in which the engagement has been undertaken. The agreement provides for continuity, certainty and allows all stakeholders to focus on the sustainability of the business going forward.”
