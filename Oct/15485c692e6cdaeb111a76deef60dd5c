Following the approval of MC Mining's ammended environmental authorisation for the transport of coal to the Musina rail siding by road instead of rail, the same interest group that unsuccessfully appealed against the original Makhado EA, has appealed Limpopo Department of Economic Development, Environment and Tourism's decision. The appeal results in the suspension of the amendment authorisation and MC Mining will follow due process to have the appeal dismissed. MC Mining is an emerging developer of high-quality coking and thermal coal assets, located primarily in the Limpopo province of South Africa. MC Mining, which focuses on its metallurgical coal assets, is listed on the AIM, ASX and JSE. The company’s key projects include the Uitkomst Collierp, Makhado project, Vele Colliery and the Greater Soutpansberg projects – MbeuYashu. MC Mining's Makhado project is situated in the Limpopo province, north of Soutpansberg Mountains, 65 km southwest of Musina, 80 km southeast of Vele project. The project has an existing rail from Musina directly to Matola as well as road, power (Eskom) and port allocation (Matola Coal terminal). The life of mine is 45 years with 12.6 Mtpa run of mine coal yielding 2.3 Mtpa hard coking coal and 3.2 Mtpa thermal coal for domestic or export markets.
