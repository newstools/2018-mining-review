The organisers of Nigeria Mining Week have announced the platinum sponsorship of the Bank of Industry at the third edition of the event in Abuja from 15-17 October. “Nigeria is blessed with several mineral resources and there is a need for collective effort by all stakeholders to move the mining sector forward” says Mrs Olayinka Mubarak, Group Head, Solid Minerals & Metals at the Bank of Industry. She adds: “the Government has done a lot to address the various challenges facing the mining sector. My vision for the sector would be for this effort by the government to start translating into positive impact in the sector. This should include creating an enabling environment for both local and foreign investors, growth in the mining sector and export of refined minerals from Nigeria.” Bank of Industry supports a lot of projects in the industry says Mrs Mubarak, “in particular a company in a very rural community that makes steel products such as rebars, strip steel and wire-rods. The most exciting aspect of this project is the indirect employment it has generated as well as the businesses that are spring up around the company. A community that hitherto had no infrastructure is fast becoming urbanized due to the presence of this company.” Driving the sector forward
“Nigeria Mining Week is a welcomed development for the mining sector in Nigeria” says Bank of Industry’s Olayinka Mubarak, explaining: “the event is the largest gathering of miners in Nigeria, last year it had international participants from over 13 countries and has continued to evolve over the years. Discussions are usually focused on how to drive the sector forward. The event has a match making platform for would-be investors and also offers a mentoring program.” Click here for the full interview with Mrs Olayinka Mubarak.
