Northam has announced the appointment of Aletta Helena Coetzee as successor to  Ayanda Khumalo, current CFO of the company, with effect from 15 November 2018. This follows a decision by Khumalo to step down, effective 1 November 2018. He will be taking time off before embarking on the next phase of his career. Coetzee has been part of Northam’s senior management team since joining the group in December 2015. The appointment of Coetzee arises from a comprehensive process followed by the board of directors to find a suitable replacement for Khumalo. Coetzee is a Chartered Accountant (South Africa) and former associate director at Ernst & Young, Northam’s external auditor. Coetzee worked at EY for almost 14 years and has been involved with the group since June 2007 when she first joined the external audit team. The board of Northam has full confidence in Coetzee’s ability to seamlessly take over from Khumalo and is pleased to have found a highly qualified and experienced replacement.
